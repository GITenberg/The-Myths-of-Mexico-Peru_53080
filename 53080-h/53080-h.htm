<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In recent years a reawakening has taken place in
the study of American arch&aelig;ology and antiquities, owing chiefly
to the labours of a band of scholars in the United States and a few
enthusiasts in the continent of Europe. For the greater part of the
nineteenth century it appeared as if the last word had been written
upon Mexican arch&aelig;ology. The lack of excavations and exploration
had cramped the outlook of scholars, and there was nothing for them to
work upon save what had been done in this respect before their own
time. The writers on Central America who lived in the third quarter of
the last century relied on the travels of Stephens and Norman, and
never appeared to consider it essential that the country or the
antiquities in which they specialised should be examined anew, or that
fresh expeditions should be equipped to discover whether still further
monuments existed relating to the ancient peoples who raised the
<i>teocallis</i> of Mexico and the <i>huacas</i> of Peru. True, the
middle of the century was not altogether without its Americanist
explorers, but the researches of these were performed in a manner so
perfunctory that but few additions to the science resulted from their
labours.</p>
<p class="par">Modern Americanist arch&aelig;ology may be said to have
been the creation of a brilliant band of scholars who, working far
apart and without any attempt at co-operation, yet succeeded in
accomplishing much. Among these may be mentioned the Frenchmen Charnay
and de Rosny, and the Americans Brinton, H. H. Bancroft, and Squier. To
these succeeded the German scholars Seler, Schellhas, and
F&ouml;rstemann, the Americans Winsor, Starr, Savile, and Cyrus Thomas,
and the Englishmen Payne and Sir Clements Markham. These men,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd22e183" href="#xd22e183" name=
"xd22e183">vi</a>]</span>splendidly equipped for the work they had
taken in hand, were yet hampered by the lack of reliable data&mdash;a
want later supplied partly by their own excavations and partly by the
painstaking labours of Professor Maudslay, now the principal of the
International College of Antiquities at Mexico, who, with his wife, is
responsible for the exact pictorial reproductions of many of the
ancient edifices in Central America and Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">Writers in the sphere of Mexican and Peruvian myth have
been few. The first to attack the subject in the light of the modern
science of comparative religion was Daniel Garrison Brinton, professor
of American languages and arch&aelig;ology in the University of
Philadelphia. He has been followed by Payne, Schellhas, Seler, and
F&ouml;rstemann, all of whom, however, have confined the publication of
their researches to isolated articles in various geographical and
scientific journals. The remarks of mythologists who are not also
Americanists upon the subject of American myth must be accepted with
caution.</p>
<p class="par">The question of the alphabets of ancient America is
perhaps the most acute in present-day pre-Columbian arch&aelig;ology.
But progress is being made in this branch of the subject, and several
German scholars are working in whole-hearted co-operation to secure
final results.</p>
<p class="par">What has Great Britain accomplished in this new and
fascinating field of science? If the lifelong and valuable labours of
the venerable Sir Clements Markham be excepted, almost nothing. It is
earnestly hoped that the publication of this volume may prove the means
of leading many English students to the study and consideration of
American arch&aelig;ology.</p>
<p class="par">There remains the romance of old America. The real
interest of American medi&aelig;val history must ever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd22e193" href="#xd22e193" name=
"xd22e193">vii</a>]</span>circle around Mexico and Peru&mdash;her
golden empires, her sole exemplars of civilisation; and it is to the
books upon the character of these two nations that we must turn for a
romantic interest as curious and as absorbing as that bound up in the
history of Egypt or Assyria.</p>
<p class="par">If human interest is craved for by any man, let him turn
to the narratives of Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega and Ixtlilxochitl,
representatives and last descendants of the Peruvian and Tezcucan
monarchies, and read there the frightful story of the path to fortune
of red-heeled Pizarro and cruel Cort&eacute;s, of the horrible
cruelties committed upon the red man, whose colour was &ldquo;that of
the devil,&rdquo; of the awful pageant of gold-sated pirates laden with
the treasures of palaces, of the stripping of temples whose very bricks
were of gold, whose very drain-pipes were of silver, of rapine and the
sacrilege of high places, of porphyry gods dashed down the pyramidal
sides of lofty <i>teocallis</i>, of princesses torn from the very steps
of the throne&mdash;ay, read these for the most wondrous tales ever
writ by the hand of man, tales by the side of which the fables of Araby
seem dim&mdash;the story of a clash of worlds, the conquest of a new,
of an isolated hemisphere.</p>
<p class="par">It is usual to speak of America as &ldquo;a continent
without a history.&rdquo; The folly of such a statement is extreme. For
centuries prior to European occupation Central America was the seat of
civilisations boasting a history and a semi-historical mythology second
to none in richness and interest. It is only because the sources of
that history are unknown to the general reader that such assurance upon
the lack of it exists.</p>
<p class="par">Let us hope that this book may assist in attracting many
to the head-fountain of a river whose affluents water many a plain of
beauty not the less lovely because <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd22e204" href="#xd22e204" name="xd22e204">viii</a>]</span>bizarre,
not the less fascinating because somewhat remote from modern
thought.</p>
<p class="par">In conclusion I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, which placed in my hands a valuable
collection of illustrations and allowed me to select from these at my
discretion. The pictures chosen include the drawings used as tailpieces
to chapters; others, usually half-tones, are duly acknowledged where
they occur.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Civilisations of the New World</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is now no question as to the indigenous
origin of the civilisations of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. Upon
few subjects, however, has so much mistaken erudition been lavished.
The beginnings of the races who inhabited these regions, and the
cultures which they severally created, have been referred to nearly
every civilised or semi-civilised nation of antiquity, and wild if
fascinating theories have been advanced with the intention of showing
that civilisation was initiated upon American soil by Asiatic or
European influence. These speculations were for the most part put
forward by persons who possessed but a merely general acquaintance with
the circumstances of American aboriginal civilisation, and who were
struck by the superficial resemblances which undoubtedly exist between
American and Asiatic peoples, customs, and art-forms, but which cease
to be apparent to the Americanist, who perceives in them only such
likenesses as inevitably occur in the work of men situated in similar
environments and surrounded by similar social and religious
conditions.</p>
<p class="par">The Maya of Yucatan may be regarded as the most highly
civilised of the peoples who occupied the American continent before the
advent of Europeans, and it is usually their culture which we are asked
to believe had its seat of origin in Asia. It is unnecessary to refute
this theory in detail, as that has already been ably
accomplished.<a class="noteref" id="xd22e783src" href="#xd22e783" name=
"xd22e783src">1</a> But it may be remarked that the surest proof of the
purely native origin of American <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2"
href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>civilisation is to be found in the
unique nature of American art, the undoubted result of countless
centuries of isolation. American language, arithmetic, and methods of
time-reckoning, too, bear no resemblance to other systems, European or
Asiatic, and we may be certain that had a civilising race entered
America from Asia it would have left its indelible impress upon things
so intensely associated with the life of a people as well as upon the
art and architecture of the country, for they are as much the product
of culture as is the ability to raise temples.</p>

<h3 class="main">Evidence of Animal and Plant Life</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is impossible in this connection to ignore the
evidence in favour of native advancement which can be adduced from the
artificial production of food in America. Nearly all the domesticated
animals and cultivated food-plants found on the continent at the period
of the discovery were totally different from those known to the Old
World. Maize, cocoa, tobacco, and the potato, with a host of useful
plants, were new to the European conquerors, and the absence of such
familiar animals as the horse, cow, and sheep, besides a score of
lesser animals, is eloquent proof of the prolonged isolation which the
American continent underwent subsequent to its original settlement by
man.</p>

<h3 class="main">Origin of American Man</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An Asiatic origin is, of course, admitted for the
aborigines of America, but it undoubtedly stretched back into that dim
Tertiary Era when man was little more than beast, and language as yet
was not, or at the best was only half formed. Later immigrants there
certainly were, but these probably arrived by way of Behring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>Strait, and not by the land-bridge connecting Asia
and America by which the first-comers found entrance. At a later
geological period the general level of the North American continent was
higher than at present, and a broad isthmus connected it with Asia.
During this prolonged elevation vast littoral plains, now submerged,
extended continuously from the American to the Asiatic shore, affording
an easy route of migration to a type of man from whom both the
Mongolian branches may have sprung. But this type, little removed from
the animal as it undoubtedly was, carried with it none of the
refinements of art or civilisation; and if any resemblances occur
between the art-forms or polity of its equal descendants in Asia and
America, they are due to the influence of a remote common ancestry, and
not to any later influx of Asiatic civilisation to American shores.</p>

<h3 class="main">Traditions of Intercourse with Asia</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The few traditions of Asiatic intercourse with
America are, alas! easily dissipated. It is a dismal business to be
compelled to refute the dreams of others. How much more fascinating
would American history have been had Asia sowed the seeds of her own
peculiar civilisation in the western continent, which would then have
become a newer and further East, a more glowing and golden Orient! But
America possesses a fascination almost as intense when there falls to
be considered the marvel of the evolution of her wondrous
civilisations&mdash;the flowers of progress of a new, of an isolated
world.</p>
<p class="par">The idea that the &ldquo;Fu-Sang&rdquo; of the Chinese
annals alluded to America was rendered illusory by Klaproth, who showed
its identity with a Japanese island. It is not impossible that Chinese
and Japanese vessels may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>have drifted on to the American coasts, but
that they sailed thither of set purpose is highly improbable. Gomara,
the Mexican historian, states that those who served with
Coronado&rsquo;s expedition in 1542 saw off the Pacific coast certain
ships having their prows decorated with gold and silver, and laden with
merchandise, and these they supposed to be of Cathay or China,
&ldquo;because they intimated by signs that they had been thirty days
on their voyage.&rdquo; Like most of these interesting stories,
however, the tale has no foundation in fact, as the incident cannot be
discovered in the original account of the expedition, published in 1838
in the travel-collection of Ternaux-Compans.</p>

<h3 class="main">Legends of European Intercourse</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We shall find the traditions, one might almost
call them legends, of early European intercourse with America little
more satisfactory than those which recount its ancient connection with
Asia. We may dismiss the sagas of the discovery of America by the
Norsemen, which are by no means mere tradition, and pass on to those in
which the basis of fact is weaker and the legendary interest more
strong. We are told that when the Norsemen drove forth those Irish
monks who had settled in Iceland, the fugitives voyaged to &ldquo;Great
Ireland,&rdquo; by which many antiquarians of the older school imagine
the author of the myth to have meant America. The Irish <i>Book of
Lismore</i> recounts the voyage of St. Brandan, Abbot of Cluainfert, in
Ireland, to an island in the ocean which Providence had intended as the
abode of saints. It gives a glowing account of his seven years&rsquo;
cruise in western waters, and tells of numerous discoveries, among them
a hill of fire and an endless island, which he quitted after an
unavailing journey of forty days, loading his ships <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>with its
fruits, and returning home. Many Norse legends exist regarding this
&ldquo;Greater Ireland,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Huitramanna Land&rdquo; (White
Man&rsquo;s Land), among them one concerning a Norseman who was cast
away on its shores, and who found there a race of white men who went to
worship their gods bearing banners, and &ldquo;shouting with a loud
voice.&rdquo; There is, of course, the bare possibility that the roving
Norsemen may have on occasions drifted or have been cast away as far
south as Mexico, and such an occurrence becomes the more easy of belief
when we remember that they certainly reached the shores of North
America.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Legend of Madoc</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A much more interesting because more probable
story is that which tells of the discovery of distant lands across the
western ocean by Madoc, a princeling of North Wales, in the year 1170.
It is recorded in Hakluyt&rsquo;s <i>English Voyages</i> and
Powel&rsquo;s <i>History of Wales</i>. Madoc, the son of Owen Gwyneth,
disgusted by the strife of his brothers for the principality of their
dead father, resolved to quit such an uncongenial atmosphere, and,
fitting out ships with men and munition, sought adventure by sea,
sailing west, and leaving the coast of Ireland so far north that he
came to a land unknown, where he saw many strange things. &ldquo;This
land,&rdquo; says Hakluyt, &ldquo;must needs be some part of that
country of which the Spaniards affirme themselves to be the first
finders since Hanno&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; and through this allusion we
are enabled to see how these legends relating to mythical lands came to
be associated with the American continent. Concerning the land
discovered by Madoc many tales were current in Wales in medi&aelig;val
times. Madoc on his return declared that it was pleasant and fruitful,
but uninhabited. He succeeded in persuading <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>a large
number of people to accompany him to this delectable region, and, as he
never returned, Hakluyt concludes that the descendants of the folk he
took with him composed the greater part of the population of the
America of the seventeenth century, a conclusion in which he has been
supported by more than one modern antiquarian. Indeed, the wildest
fancies have been based upon this legend, and stories of Welsh-speaking
Indians who were able to converse with Cymric immigrants to the
American colonies have been received with complacency by the older
school of American historians as the strongest confirmation of the
saga. It is notable, however, that Henry VII of England, the son of a
Welshman, may have been influenced in his patronage of the early
American explorers by this legend of Madoc, as it is known that he
employed one Guttyn Owen, a Welsh historiographer, to draw up his
paternal pedigree, and that this same Guttyn included the story in his
works. Such legends as those relating to Atlantis and Antilia scarcely
fall within the scope of American myth, as they undoubtedly relate to
early communication with the Canaries and Azores.</p>

<h3 class="main">American Myths of the Discovery</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But what were the speculations of the Red Men on
the other side of the Atlantic? Were there no rumours there, no legends
of an Eastern world? Immediately prior to the discovery there was in
America a widely disseminated belief that at a relatively remote period
strangers from the east had visited American soil, eventually returning
to their own abodes in the Land of Sunrise. Such, for example, was the
Mexican legend of Quetzalcoatl, to which we shall revert later in its
more essentially mythical connection. He landed with several companions
at Vera Cruz, and speedily brought to bear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>the power of
a civilising agency upon native opinion. In the ancient Mexican
<i>pinturas</i>, or paintings, he is represented as being habited in a
long black gown, fringed with white crosses. After sojourning with the
Mexicans for a number of years, during which time he initiated them
into the arts of life and civilisation, he departed from their land on
a magic raft, promising, however, to return. His second advent was
anxiously looked for, and when Cort&eacute;s and his companions arrived
at Vera Cruz, the identical spot at which Quetzalcoatl was supposed to
have set out on his homeward journey, the Mexicans fully believed him
to be the returned hero. Of course Montezuma, their monarch, was not
altogether taken by surprise at the coming of the white man, as he had
been informed of the arrival of mysterious strangers in Yucatan and
elsewhere in Central America; but in the eyes of the commonalty the
Spanish leader was a &ldquo;hero-god&rdquo; indeed. In this interesting
figure several of the monkish chroniclers of New Spain saw the Apostle
St. Thomas, who had journeyed to the American continent to effect its
conversion to Christianity.</p>

<h3 class="main">A Peruvian Prophecy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Mexicans were by no means singular in their
presentiments. When Hernando de Soto, on landing in Peru, first met the
Inca Huascar, the latter related an ancient prophecy which his father,
Huaina Ccapac, had repeated on his death-bed, that in the reign of the
thirteenth Inca white men of surpassing strength and valour would come
from their father the Sun, and subject the Peruvians to their rule.
&ldquo;I command you,&rdquo; said the dying king, &ldquo;to yield them
homage and obedience, for they will be of a nature superior to
ours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd22e850src" href="#xd22e850" name=
"xd22e850src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">But the most interesting of American legends connected
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>with the discovery is that in which the prophecy of
the Maya priest Chilan Balam is described. Father Lizana, a venerable
Spanish author, records the prophecy, which he states was very well
known throughout Yucatan, as does Villagutierre, who quotes it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd22e860" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Prophecy of Chilan Balam</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Part of this strange prophecy runs as follows:
&ldquo;At the end of the thirteenth age, when Itza is at the height of
its power, as also the city called Tancah, the signal of God will
appear on the heights, and the Cross with which the world was
enlightened will be manifested. There will be variance of men&rsquo;s
will in future times, when this signal shall be brought.... Receive
your barbarous bearded guests from the east, who bring the signal of
God, who comes to us in mercy and pity. The time of our life is
coming....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It would seem from the perusal of this prophecy that a
genuine substratum of native tradition has been over-laid and coloured
by the influence of the early Spanish missionaries. The terms of the
announcement are much too exact, and the language employed is obviously
Scriptural. But the native books of Chilan Balam, whence the prophecy
is taken, are much less explicit, and the genuineness of their
character is evinced by the idiomatic use of the Maya tongue, which, in
the form they present it in, could have been written by none save those
who had habitually employed it from infancy. As regards the prophetic
nature of these deliverances it is known that the Chilan, or priest,
was wont to utter publicly at the end of certain prolonged periods a
prophecy forecasting the character of the similar period to come, and
there is reason to believe that some distant rumours of the coming of
the white man had reached the ears of several of the seers.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">These vague intimations that the seas separated them
from a great continent where dwelt beings like themselves seem to have
been common to white and red men alike. And who shall say by what
strange magic of telepathy they were inspired in the minds of the
daring explorers and the ascetic priests who gave expression to them in
act and utterance? The discovery of America was much more than a mere
scientific process, and romance rather than the cold speculations of
medi&aelig;val geography urged men to tempt the dim seas of the West in
quest of golden islands seen in dreams.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Type of Mexican Civilisation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first civilised American people with whom the
discoverers came into contact were those of the Nahua or ancient
Mexican race. We use the term &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; advisedly, for
although several authorities of standing have refused to regard the
Mexicans as a people who had achieved such a state of culture as would
entitle them to be classed among civilised communities, there is no
doubt that they had advanced nearly as far as it was possible for them
to proceed when their environment and the nature of the circumstances
which handicapped them are taken into consideration. In architecture
they had evolved a type of building, solid yet wonderfully graceful,
which, if not so massive as the Egyptian and Assyrian, was yet more
highly decorative. Their artistic outlook as expressed in their
painting and pottery was more versatile and less conventional than that
of the ancient people of the Orient, their social system was of a more
advanced type, and a less rigorous attitude was evinced by the ruling
caste toward the subject classes. Yet, on the other hand, the picture
is darkened by the terrible if picturesque <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>rites
which attended their religious ceremonies, and the dread shadow of
human sacrifice which eternally overhung their teeming populations.
Nevertheless, the standard of morality was high, justice was
even-handed, the forms of government were comparatively mild, and but
for the fanaticism which demanded such troops of victims, we might
justly compare the civilisation of ancient Mexico with that of the
peoples of old China or India, if the literary activity of the Oriental
states be discounted.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mexican Race</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The race which was responsible for this varied and
highly coloured civilisation was that known as the Nahua (Those who
live by Rule), a title adopted by them to distinguish them from those
tribes who still roamed in an unsettled condition over the contiguous
plains of New Mexico and the more northerly tracts. This term was
employed by them to designate the race as a whole, but it was composed
of many diverse elements, the characteristics of which were rendered
still more various by the adoption into one or other of the tribes
which composed it of surrounding aboriginal peoples. Much controversy
has raged round the question regarding the original home of the Nahua,
but their migration legends consistently point to a northern origin;
and when the close affinity between the art-forms and mythology of the
present-day natives of British Columbia and those of the Nahua comes to
be considered along with the very persistent legends of a prolonged
pilgrimage from the North, where they dwelt in a place &ldquo;by the
water,&rdquo; the conclusion that the Nahua emanated from the region
indicated is well-nigh irresistible.<a class="noteref" id="xd22e883src"

"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In Nahua tradition the name of the locality whence the
race commenced its wanderings is called Aztlan (The Place of Reeds),
but this place-name is of little or no value as a guide to any given
region, though probably every spot betwixt Behring Strait and Mexico
has been identified with it by zealous antiquarians. Other names
discovered in the migration legends are Tlapallan (The Country of
Bright Colours) and Chicomoztoc (The Seven Caves), and these may
perhaps be identified with New Mexico or Arizona.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Legends of Mexican Migration</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">All early writers on the history of Mexico agree
that the Toltecs were the first of the several swarms of Nahua who
streamed upon the Mexican plateau in ever-widening waves. Concerning
the reality of this people so little is known that many authorities of
standing have regarded them as wholly mythical, while others profess to
see in them a veritable race, the founders of Mexican civilisation. The
author has already elaborated his theory of this difficult question
elsewhere,<a class="noteref" id="xd22e899src" href="#xd22e899" name=
"xd22e899src">4</a> but will briefly refer to it when he comes to deal
with the subject of the Toltec civilisation and the legends concerning
it. For the present we must regard the Toltecs merely as a race alluded
to in a migration myth as the first Nahua immigrants to the region of
Mexico. Ixtlilxochitl, a native chronicler who flourished shortly after
the Spanish conquest of Mexico, gives two separate accounts of the
early Toltec migrations, the first of which goes back to the period of
their arrival in the fabled land of Tlapallan, alluded to above. In
this account Tlapallan is described as a region near the sea, which the
Toltecs reached by voyaging southward, skirting the coasts of
California. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>This account must be received with the greatest
caution. But we know that the natives of British Columbia have been
expert in the use of the canoe from an early period, and that the
Mexican god Quetzalcoatl, who is probably originally derived from a
common source with their deity Yetl, is represented as being skilled in
the management of the craft. It is, therefore, not outside the bounds
of possibility that the early swarms of Nahua immigrants made their way
to Mexico by sea, but it is much more probable that their migrations
took place by land, following the level country at the base of the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Toltec Upheaval</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Like nearly all legendary immigrants, the Toltecs
did not set out to colonise distant countries from any impulse of their
own, but were the victims of internecine dissension in the homeland,
and were expelled from the community to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
Thus thrust forth, they set their faces southward, and reached
Tlapallan in the year 1 Tecpatl (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 387).
Passing the country of Xalisco, they effected a landing at Huatulco,
and journeyed down the coast until they reached Tochtepec, whence they
pushed inland to Tollantzinco. To enable them to make this journey they
required no less than 104 years. Ixtlilxochitl furnishes another
account of the Toltec migration in his <i lang="es">Relaciones</i>, a
work dealing with the early history of the Mexican races. In this he
recounts how the chiefs of Tlapallan, who had revolted against the
royal power, were banished from that region in <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 439. Lingering near their ancient territory for the
space of eight years, they then journeyed to Tlapallantzinco, where
they halted for three years before setting out on a prolonged
pilgrimage, which occupied the tribe for over a century, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>and in
the course of which it halted at no less than thirteen different
resting-places, six of which can be traced to stations on the Pacific
coast, and the remainder to localities in the north of Mexico.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is plain from internal evidence that these two
legends of the Toltec migrations present an artificial aspect. But if
we cannot credit them in detail, that is not to say that they do not
describe in part an actual pilgrimage. They are specimens of numerous
migration myths which are related concerning the various branches of
the Mexican races. Few features of interest are presented in them, and
they are chiefly remarkable for wearisome repetition and divergence in
essential details.</p>

<h3 class="main">Myths of the Toltecs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But we enter a much more fascinating domain when
we come to peruse the myths regarding the Toltec kingdom and
civilisation, for, before entering upon the origin or veritable history
of the Toltec race, it will be better to consider the native legends
concerning them. These exhibit an almost Oriental exuberance of
imagination and colouring, and forcibly remind the reader of the
gorgeous architectural and scenic descriptions in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>. The principal sources of these legends are the histories of
Zumarraga and Ixtlilxochitl. The latter is by no means a satisfactory
authority, but he has succeeded in investing the traditions of his
native land with no inconsiderable degree of charm. The Toltecs, he
says, founded the magnificent city of Tollan in the year 566 of the
Incarnation. This city, the site of which is now occupied by the modern
town of Tula, was situated north-west of the mountains which bound the
Mexican valley. Thither <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>were the Toltecs guided by the
powerful necromancer Hueymatzin (Great Hand), and under his direction
they decided to build a city upon the site of what had been their place
of bivouac. For six years they toiled at the building of Tollan, and
magnificent edifices, palaces, and temples arose, the whole forming a
capital of a splendour unparalleled in the New World. The valley
wherein it stood was known as the &ldquo;Place of Fruits,&rdquo; in
allusion to its great fertility. The surrounding rivers teemed with
fish, and the hills which encircled this delectable site sheltered
large herds of game. But as yet the Toltecs were without a ruler, and
in the seventh year of their occupation of the city the assembled
chieftains took counsel together, and resolved to surrender their power
into the hands of a monarch whom the people might elect. The choice
fell upon Chalchiuh Tlatonac (Shining Precious Stone), who reigned for
fifty-two years.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Happily settled in their new country, and ruled
over by a king whom they could regard with reverence, the Toltecs made
rapid progress in the various arts, and their city began to be
celebrated far and wide for the excellence of its craftsmen and the
beauty of its architecture and pottery. The name of
&ldquo;Toltec,&rdquo; in fact, came to be regarded by the surrounding
peoples as synonymous with &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; and as a kind of
hall-mark which guaranteed the superiority of any article of Toltec
workmanship. Everything in and about the city was eloquent of the taste
and artistry of its founders. The very walls were encrusted with rare
stones, and their masonry was so beautifully chiselled and laid as to
resemble the choicest mosaic. One of the edifices of which the
inhabitants of Tollan were most justly proud <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>was the
temple wherein their high-priest officiated. This building was a very
gem of architectural art and mural decoration. It contained four
apartments. The walls of the first were inlaid with gold, the second
with precious stones of every description, the third with beautiful
sea-shells of all conceivable hues and of the most brilliant and tender
shades encrusted in bricks of silver, which sparkled in the sun in such
a manner as to dazzle the eyes of beholders. The fourth apartment was
formed of a brilliant red stone, ornamented with shells.</p>

<p class="par first">Still more fantastic and weirdly beautiful was
another edifice, &ldquo;The House of Feathers.&rdquo; This also
possessed four apartments, one decorated with feathers of a brilliant
yellow, another with the radiant and sparkling hues of the Blue Bird.
These were woven into a kind of tapestry, and placed against the walls
in graceful hangings and festoons. An apartment described as of
entrancing beauty was that in which the decorative scheme consisted of
plumage of the purest and most dazzling white. The remaining chamber
was hung with feathers of a brilliant red, plucked from the most
beautiful birds.</p>

<p class="par first">A succession of more or less able kings succeeded
the founder of the Toltec monarchy, until in <span class=

first with wisdom, and paid great attention to the duties of the state
and religion. But later he fell from the high place he had made for
himself in the regard of the people by his faithless deception of them
and his intemperate and licentious habits. The provinces rose in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>revolt, and many signs and gloomy omens foretold
the downfall of the city. Toveyo, a cunning sorcerer, collected a great
concourse of people near Tollan, and by dint of beating upon a magic
drum until the darkest hours of the night, forced them to dance to its
sound until, exhausted by their efforts, they fell headlong over a
dizzy precipice into a deep ravine, where they were turned into stone.
Toveyo also maliciously destroyed a stone bridge, so that thousands of
people fell into the river beneath and were drowned. The neighbouring
volcanoes burst into eruption, presenting a frightful aspect, and
grisly apparitions could be seen among the flames threatening the city
with terrible gestures of menace.</p>

<p class="par">The rulers of Tollan resolved to lose no time in
placating the gods, whom they decided from the portents must have
conceived the most violent wrath against their capital. They therefore
ordained a great sacrifice of war-captives. But upon the first of the
victims being placed upon the altar a still more terrible catastrophe
occurred. In the method of sacrifice common to the Nahua race the
breast of a youth was opened for the purpose of extracting the heart,
but no such organ could the officiating priest perceive. Moreover the
veins of the victim were bloodless. Such a deadly odour was exhaled
from the corpse that a terrible pestilence arose, which caused the
death of thousands of Toltecs. Huemac, the unrighteous monarch who had
brought all this suffering upon his folk, was confronted in the forest
by the Tlalocs, or gods of moisture, and humbly petitioned these
deities to spare him, and not to take from him his wealth and rank. But
the gods were disgusted at the callous selfishness displayed in his
desires, and departed, threatening the Toltec race with six years of
plagues. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=

land that all crops and plants were killed. A summer of torrid heat
followed, so intense in its suffocating fierceness that the streams
were dried up and the very rocks were melted. Then heavy rain-storms
descended, which flooded the streets and ways, and terrible tempests
swept through the land. Vast numbers of loathsome toads invaded the
valley, consuming the refuse left by the destructive frost and heat,
and entering the very houses of the people. In the following year a
terrible drought caused the death of thousands from starvation, and the
ensuing winter was again a marvel of severity. Locusts descended in
cloud-like swarms, and hail- and thunder-storms completed the wreck.
During these visitations nine-tenths of the people perished, and all
artistic endeavour ceased because of the awful struggle for food.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">With the cessation of these inflictions the wicked
Huemac resolved upon a more upright course of life, and became most
assiduous for the welfare and proper government of his people. But he
had announced that Acxitl, his illegitimate son, should succeed him,
and had further resolved to abdicate at once in favour of this youth.
With the Toltecs, as with most primitive peoples, the early kings were
regarded as divine, and the attempt to place on the throne one who was
not of the royal blood was looked upon as a serious offence against the
gods. A revolt ensued, but its two principal leaders were bought over
by promises of preferment. Acxitl ascended the throne, and for a time
ruled wisely. But he soon, like his father, gave way to a life of
dissipation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>and succeeded in setting a bad example to the
members of his court and to the priesthood, the vicious spirit
communicating itself to all classes of his subjects and permeating
every rank of society. The iniquities of the people of the capital and
the enormities practised by the royal favourites caused such scandal in
the outlying provinces that at length they broke into open revolt, and
Huehuetzin, chief of an eastern viceroyalty, joined to himself two
other malcontent lords and marched upon the city of Tollan at the head
of a strong force. Acxitl could not muster an army sufficiently
powerful to repel the rebels, and was forced to resort to the expedient
of buying them off with rich presents, thus patching up a truce. But
the fate of Tollan was in the balance. Hordes of rude Chichimec
savages, profiting by the civil broils in the Toltec state, invaded the
lake region of Anahuac, or Mexico, and settled upon its fruitful soil.
The end was in sight!</p>

wise men of the realm met at Teotihuacan, the sacred city of the
Toltecs. But during their deliberations a giant of immense proportions
rushed into their midst, and, seizing upon them by scores with his bony
hands, hurled them to the ground, dashing their brains out. In this
manner he slew great numbers, and when the panic-stricken folk imagined
themselves delivered from him he returned in a different guise and slew
many more. Again the grisly monster appeared, this time taking the form
of a beautiful child. The people, fascinated by its loveliness, ran to
observe it more closely, only to discover that its head was a mass of
corruption, the stench from which was so <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

killed outright. The fiend who had thus plagued the Toltecs at length

prayers, but had fully resolved to destroy them root and branch, and he
further counselled them to seek safety in flight.</p>

deserted the country, taking refuge in neighbouring states. Once more
Huehuetzin menaced Tollan, and by dint of almost superhuman efforts old
King Huemac, who had left his retirement, raised a force sufficient to
face the enemy. Acxitl&rsquo;s mother enlisted the services of the
women of the city, and formed them into a regiment of Amazons. At the
head of all was Acxitl, who divided his forces, despatching one portion
to the front under his commander-in-chief, and forming the other into a
reserve under his own leadership. During three years the king defended
Tollan against the combined forces of the rebels and the semi-savage
Chichimecs. At length the Toltecs, almost decimated, fled after a final
desperate battle into the marshes of Lake Tezcuco and the fastnesses of
the mountains. Their other cities were given over to destruction, and
the Toltec empire was at an end.</p>

had for many years carried on a constant warfare with the Toltecs, were
surprised that their enemies sought their borders no more, a practice
which they had engaged in principally for the purpose of obtaining
captives for sacrifice. In order to discover the reason for this
suspicious quiet they sent out spies into Toltec <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

the Toltec domain for a distance of six hundred miles from the
Chichimec frontier was a desert, the towns ruined and empty and their
inhabitants scattered. Xolotl, the Chichimec king, summoned his
chieftains to his capital, and, acquainting them with what the spies
had said, proposed an expedition for the purpose of annexing the
abandoned land. No less than 3,202,000 people composed this migration,
and only 1,600,000 remained in the Chichimec territory.</p>
<p class="par">The Chichimecs occupied most of the ruined cities, many
of which they rebuilt. Those Toltecs who remained became peaceful
subjects, and through their knowledge of commerce and handicrafts
amassed considerable wealth. A tribute was, however, demanded from
them, which was peremptorily refused by Nauhyotl, the Toltec ruler of
Colhuacan; but he was defeated and slain, and the Chichimec rule was at
last supreme.</p>

<h3 class="main">Did the Toltecs Exist?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Some authorities have questioned the existence of
the Toltecs, and have professed to see in them a race which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>had merely a mythical significance. They base this
theory upon the circumstance that the duration of the reigns of the
several Toltec monarchs is very frequently stated to have lasted for
exactly fifty-two years, the duration of the great Mexican cycle of
years which had been adopted so that the ritual calendar might coincide
with the solar year. The circumstance is certainly suspicious, as is
the fact that many of the names of the Toltec monarchs are also those
of the principal Nahua deities, and this renders the whole dynastic
list of very doubtful value. Dr. Brinton recognised in the Toltecs
those children of the sun who, like their brethren in Peruvian
mythology, were sent from heaven to civilise the human race, and his
theory is by no means weakened by the circumstance that Quetzalcoatl, a
deity of solar significance, is alluded to in Nahua myth as King of the
Toltecs. Recent considerations and discoveries, however, have virtually
forced students of the subject to admit the existence of the Toltecs as
a race. The author has dealt with the question at some length
elsewhere,<a class="noteref" id="xd22e1017src" href="#xd22e1017" name=
"xd22e1017src">5</a> and is not of those who are free to admit the
definite existence of the Toltecs from a historical point of view. The
late Mr. Payne of Oxford, an authority entitled to every respect, gave
it as his opinion that &ldquo;the accounts of Toltec history current at
the conquest contain a nucleus of substantial truth,&rdquo; and he
writes convincingly: &ldquo;To doubt that there once existed in Tollan
an advancement superior to that which prevailed among the Nahuatlaca
generally at the conquest, and that its people spread their advancement
throughout Anahuac, and into the districts eastward and southward,
would be to reject a belief universally entertained, and confirmed
rather than shaken by the efforts made in later times to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=

historical existence is rather more non-committal. He admits that a
most persistent body of tradition as to their existence gained general
credence among the Nahua, and that the date (1055) of their alleged
dispersal admits of the approximate exactness and probability of this
body of tradition at the time of the conquest. He also admits that the
site of Tollan contains ruins which are undoubtedly of a date earlier
than that of the architecture of the Nahua as known at the conquest,
and that numerous evidences of an older civilisation exist. He also
believes that the early Nahua having within their racial recollection
existed as savages, the time which elapsed between their barbarian
condition and the more advanced state which they achieved was too brief
to admit of evolution from savagery to culture. Hence they must have
adopted an older civilisation, especially as through the veneer of
civilisation possessed by them they exhibited every sign of gross
barbarism.</p>

<p class="par first">If this be true it would go to show that a people

the Mexican tableland. But what their name was or their racial affinity
the writer does not profess to know. Many modern American scholars of
note have conferred upon them the name of &ldquo;Toltecs,&rdquo; and
speak freely of the &ldquo;Toltec period&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Toltec
art.&rdquo; It may appear pedantic to refuse to recognise that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=

times were &ldquo;the Toltecs.&rdquo; But in the face of the absence of
genuine and authoritative native written records dealing with the
question, the author finds himself compelled to remain unconvinced as
to the exact designation of the mysterious older race which preceded
the Nahua. There are not wanting authorities who appear to regard the
pictorial chronicles of the Nahua as quite as worthy of credence as
written records, but it must be clear that tradition or even history
set down in pictorial form can never possess that degree of
definiteness contained in a written account.</p>

flint, porphyry, basalt, and obsidian. In the manufacture of jewellery

the Toltecs. Of these many and diverse peoples the most remarkable were
the Otomi, who still occupy Guanajuato and Queretaro, and who, before
the coming of the Nahua, probably spread over the entire valley of
Mexico. In the south we find the Huasteca, a people speaking the same
language as the Maya of Central America, and on the Mexican Gulf the
Totonacs and Chontals. On the Pacific side of the country the Mixteca
and Zapoteca were responsible for a flourishing civilisation which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=

in some degree was a link between the cultures of Mexico and Central
America. Traces of a still older population than any of these are still

Kuicatec, and Popolcan are probably the remnants of prehistoric races

<h3 class="main">The Cliff-dwellers</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is probable that a race known as &ldquo;the
Cliff-dwellers,&rdquo; occupying the plateau country of Arizona, New
Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, and even extending in its ramifications to
Mexico itself, was related ethnologically to the Nahua. The present-day
Pueblo Indians dwelling to the north of Mexico most probably possess a
leaven of Nahua blood. Ere the tribes who communicated this leaven to
the whole had intermingled with others of various origin, it would
appear that they occupied with others those tracts of country now
inhabited by the Pueblo Indians, and in the natural recesses and
shallow caverns found in the faces of the cliffs erected dwellings and
fortifications, displaying an architectural ability of no mean order.
These communities extended as far south as the Gila river, the most
southern affluent of the Colorado, and the remains they have left there
appear to be of a later date architecturally than those situated
farther north. These were found in ruins by the first Spanish
explorers, and it is thought that their builders were eventually driven
back to rejoin their kindred in the north. Farther to the south in the
ca&ntilde;ons of the Piedras Verdes river in Chihuahua, Mexico, are
cliff-dwellings corresponding in many respects with those of the Pueblo
region, and Dr. Hrdlicka has examined others so far south as the State
of Jalisco, in Central Mexico. These may be the ruins of dwellings
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>erected either by the early Nahua or by some of
the peoples relatively aboriginal to them, and may display the
architectural features general among the Nahua prior to their adoption
of other alien forms. Or else they may be the remains of dwellings
similar to those of the Tarahumare, a still existing tribe of Mexico,
who, according to Lumholtz,<a class="noteref" id="xd22e1065src" href=
"#xd22e1065" name="xd22e1065src">7</a> inhabit similar structures at
the present day. It is clear from the architectural development of the
cliff-dwellers that their civilisation developed generally from south
to north, that this race was cognate to the early Nahua, and that it
later withdrew to the north, or became fused with the general body of
the Nahua peoples. It must not be understood, however, that the race
arrived in the Mexican plateau before the Nahua, and the ruins of
Jalisco and other mid-Mexican districts may merely be the remains of
comparatively modern cliff-dwellings, an adaptation by mid-Mexican
communities of the &ldquo;Cliff-dweller&rdquo; architecture, or a local
development of it owing to the exigencies of early life in the
district.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Nahua peoples included all those tribes
speaking the Nahuatlatolli (Nahua tongue), and occupied a sphere
extending from the southern borders of New Mexico to the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec on the south, or very much within the limits of the modern
Republic of Mexico. But this people must not be regarded as one race of
homogeneous origin. A very brief account of their racial affinities
must be sufficient here. The Chichimecs were probably related to the
Otomi, whom we have alluded to as among the first-comers to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>Mexican valley. They were traditionally supposed
to have entered it at a period subsequent to the Toltec occupation.
Their chief towns were Tezcuco and Tenayucan, but they later allied
themselves with the Nahua in a great confederacy, and adopted the Nahua
language. There are circumstances which justify the assumption that on
their entrance to the Mexican valley they consisted of a number of
tribes loosely united, presenting in their general organisation a close
resemblance to some of the composite tribes of modern American
Indians.</p>

themselves. Gomara states in his <i lang="es">Conquista de Mexico</i>
that they arrived in the valley from Acolhuacan about <span class=

Mexico itself. The Acolhuans were pure Nahua, and may well have been
the much-disputed Toltecs, for the Nahua people always insisted on the
fact that the Toltecs were of the same stock as themselves, and spoke
an older and purer form of the Nahua tongue. From the Acolhuans sprang
the Tlascalans, the inveterate enemies of the Aztecs, who so heartily
assisted Cort&eacute;s in his invasion of the Aztec capital,
Tenochtitlan, or Mexico.</p>

marshlands near the Lake of Tezcuco, hard by Tlacopan. The name
Aztec&acirc; means &ldquo;Crane People,&rdquo; and was bestowed upon
the tribe by the Tecpanecs, probably because of the fact that, like
cranes, they dwelt in a marshy neighbourhood. They founded the town of
Tenochtitlan, or Mexico, and for a while paid tribute to the Tecpanecs.
But later they became the most powerful allies of that people, whom
they finally surpassed entirely in power and splendour.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Aztec Character</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The features of the Aztecs as represented in the
various Mexican paintings are typically Indian, and argue a northern
origin. The race was, and is, of average height, and the skin is of a
dark brown hue. The Mexican is grave, taciturn, and melancholic, with a
deeply rooted love of the mysterious, slow to anger, yet almost inhuman
in the violence of his passions when aroused. He is usually gifted with
a logical mind, quickness of apprehension, and an ability to regard the
subtle side of things with great nicety. Patient and imitative, the
ancient Mexican excelled in those arts which demanded such qualities in
their execution. He had a real affection for the beautiful in nature
and a passion for flowers, but the Aztec music lacked gaiety, and the
national amusements were too <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>often of a gloomy and ferocious
character. The women are more vivacious than the men, but were in the
days before the conquest very subservient to the wills of their
husbands. We have already very briefly outlined the trend of Nahua
civilisation, but it will be advisable to examine it a little more
closely, for if the myths of this people are to be understood some
knowledge of its life and general culture is essential.</p>

<h3 class="main">Legends of the Foundation of Mexico</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the period of the conquest of Mexico by
Cort&eacute;s the city presented an imposing appearance. Led to its
neighbourhood by Huitzilopochtli, a traditional chief, afterwards
deified as the god of war, there are several legends which account for
the choice of its site by the Mexicans. The most popular of these
relates how the nomadic Nahua beheld perched upon a cactus plant an
eagle of great size and majesty, grasping in its talons a huge serpent,
and spreading its wings to catch the rays of the rising sun. The
soothsayers or medicine-men of the tribe, reading a good omen in the
spectacle, advised the leaders of the people to settle on the spot,
and, hearkening to the voice of what they considered divine authority,
they proceeded to drive piles into the marshy ground, and thus laid the
foundation of the great city of Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">An elaboration of this legend tells how the Aztecs had
about the year 1325 sought refuge upon the western shore of the Lake of
Tezcuco, in an island among the marshes on which they found a stone on
which forty years before one of their priests had sacrificed a prince
of the name of Copal, whom they had made prisoner. A nopal plant had
sprung from an earth-filled crevice in this rude altar, and upon this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>the royal eagle alluded to in the former account
had alighted, grasping the serpent in his talons. Beholding in this a
good omen, and urged by a supernatural impulse which he could not
explain, a priest of high rank dived into a pool close at hand, where
he found himself face to face with Tlaloc, the god of waters. After an
interview with the deity the priest obtained permission from him to
found a city on the site, from the humble beginnings of which arose the
metropolis of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Mexico at the Conquest</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the period of the conquest the city of Mexico
had a circumference of no less than twelve miles, or nearly that of
modern Berlin without its suburbs. It contained 60,000 houses, and its
inhabitants were computed to number 300,000. Many other towns, most of
them nearly half as large, were grouped on the islands or on the margin
of Lake Tezcuco, so that the population of what might almost be called
&ldquo;Greater Mexico&rdquo; must have amounted to several millions.
The city was intersected by four great roadways or avenues built at
right angles to one another, and laid four-square with the cardinal
points. Situated as it was in the midst of a lake, it was traversed by
numerous canals, which were used as thoroughfares for traffic. The four
principal ways described above were extended across the lake as dykes
or viaducts until they met its shores. The dwellings of the poorer
classes were chiefly composed of adobes, but those of the nobility were
built of a red porous stone quarried close by. They were usually of one
story only, but occupied a goodly piece of ground and had flat roofs,
many of which were covered with flowers. In general they were coated
with a hard, white cement, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30"
href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>gave them an added resemblance
to the Oriental type of building.</p>

<p class="par">Towering high among these, and a little apart from the
vast squares and market-places, were the <i>teocallis</i>, or temples.
These were in reality not temples or covered-in buildings, but
&ldquo;high places,&rdquo; great pyramids of stone, built platform on
platform, around which a staircase led to the summit, on which was
usually erected a small shrine containing the tutelar deity to whom the
<i>teocalli</i> had been raised. The great temple of Huitzilopochtli,
the war-god, built by King Ahuizotl, was, besides being typical of all,
by far the greatest of these votive piles. The enclosing walls of the
building were 4800 feet in circumference, and strikingly decorated by
carvings representing festoons of intertwined reptiles, from which
circumstance they were called <i>coetpantli</i> (walls of serpents). A
kind of gate-house on each side gave access to the enclosure. The
<i>teocalli</i>, or great temple, inside the court was in the shape of
a parallelogram, measuring 375 feet by 300 feet, and was built in six
platforms, growing smaller in area as they descended. The mass of this
structure was composed of a mixture of rubble, clay, and earth, covered
with carefully worked stone slabs, cemented together with infinite
care, and coated with a hard gypsum. A flight of 340 steps circled
round the terraces and led to the upper platform, on which were raised
two three-storied towers 56 feet in height, in which stood the great
statues of the tutelar deities and the jasper stones of sacrifice.
These sanctuaries, say the old Conquistadores who entered them, had the
appearance and odour of shambles, and human blood was bespattered
everywhere. In this weird chapel of horrors burned a fire, the
extinction of which it was supposed would have brought about the end of
the Nahua power. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>tended with a care as scrupulous as
that with which the Roman Vestals guarded their sacred flame. No less
than 600 of these sacred braziers were kept alight in the city of
Mexico alone.</p>

in this horrid structure the Spanish conquerors counted no less than
136,000 human skulls. In the court or <i>teopan</i> which surrounded
the temple were the dwellings of thousands of priests, whose duties
included the scrupulous care of the temple precincts, and whose labours
were minutely apportioned.</p>

the sphere of Maya influence, as, for example, those of Mitla, built by
the Zapotecs, which exhibit such unmistakable signs of Maya influence
that we prefer to describe them when dealing with the antiquities of
that people.</p>

Grandes (Large Houses), the walls of which are still about 30 feet in
height. These approximate in general appearance to the buildings of
more modern tribes in New Mexico and Arizona, and may be referred to
such peoples rather than to the Nahua. At Quemada, in Zacatecas,
massive ruins of Cyclopean appearance have been discovered. These
consist of extensive terraces and broad stone causeways,
<i>teocallis</i> which have weathered many centuries, and gigantic
pillars, 18 feet in height and 17 feet in circumference. Walls 12 feet
in thickness rise above the heaps of rubbish which litter the ground.
These remains exhibit little connection with Nahua architecture to the
north or south of them. They are more massive than either, and must
have been constructed by some race which had made considerable strides
in the art of building.</p>

<h3 class="main">Teotihuacan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the district of the Totonacs, to the north of
Vera Cruz, we find many architectural remains of a highly interesting
character. Here the <i>teocalli</i> or pyramidal type of building is
occasionally crowned by a covered-in temple with the massive roof
characteristic of Maya architecture. The most striking examples found
in this region are the remains of Teotihuacan and Xochicalco. The
former was the religious Mecca of the Nahua races, and in its proximity
are still to be seen the <i>teocallis</i> of the sun and moon,
surrounded by extensive burying-grounds where the devout of Anahuac
were laid in the sure hope that if interred they would find entrance
into the paradise of the sun. The <i>teocalli</i> of the moon has a
base covering 426 feet and a height of 137 feet. That of the sun is of
greater dimensions, with a base of 735 feet and a height of 203 feet.
These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>pyramids were divided into four stories, three of
which remain. On the summit of that of the sun stood a temple
containing a great image of that luminary carved from a rough block of
stone. In the breast was inlaid a star of the purest gold, seized
afterwards as loot by the insatiable followers of Cort&eacute;s. From
the <i>teocalli</i> of the moon a path runs to where a little rivulet
flanks the &ldquo;Citadel.&rdquo; This path is known as &ldquo;The Path
of the Dead,&rdquo; from the circumstance that it is surrounded by some
nine square miles of tombs and tumuli, and, indeed, forms a road
through the great cemetery. The Citadel, thinks Charnay, was a vast
tennis or <i>tlachtli</i> court, where thousands flocked to gaze at the
national sport of the Nahua with a zest equal to that of the modern
devotees of football. Teotihuacan was a flourishing centre contemporary
with Tollan. It was destroyed, but was rebuilt by the Chichimec king
Xolotl, and preserved thenceforth its traditional sway as the focus of
the Nahua national religion. Charnay identifies the architectural types
discovered there with those of Tollan. The result of his labours in the
vicinity included the unearthing of richly decorated pottery, vases,
masks, and terra-cotta figures. He also excavated several large houses
or palaces, some with chambers more than 730 feet in circumference,
with walls over 7&ndash;1/2 feet thick, into which were built rings and
slabs to support torches and candles. The floors were tessellated in
various rich designs, &ldquo;like an Aubusson carpet.&rdquo; Charnay
concluded that the monuments of Teotihuacan were partly standing at the
time of the conquest.</p>

prove that it was the centre of a civilisation of a type distinctly
advanced. Charnay unearthed there gigantic fragments of caryatides,
each some 7 feet high. He also found columns of two pieces, which were
fitted together by means of mortise and tenon, bas-reliefs of archaic
figures of undoubted Nahua type, and many fragments of great antiquity.
On the hill of Palpan, above Tollan, he found the ground-plans of
several houses with numerous apartments, frescoed, columned, and having
benches and cisterns recalling the <i lang="la">impluvium</i> of a
Roman villa. Water-pipes were also actually unearthed, and a wealth of
pottery, many pieces of which were like old Japanese china. The
ground-plan or foundations of the houses unearthed at Palpan showed
that they had been designed by practical architects, and had not been
built in any merely haphazard fashion. The cement which covered the
walls and floors was of excellent quality, and recalled that discovered
in ancient Italian excavations. The roofs had been of wood, supported
by pillars.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Aztecs, and indeed the entire Nahua race,
employed a system of writing of the type scientifically <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>described as &ldquo;pictographic,&rdquo; in which
events, persons, and ideas were recorded by means of drawings and
coloured sketches. These were executed on paper made from the agave
plant, or were painted on the skins of animals. By these means not only
history and the principles of the Nahua mythology were communicated
from generation to generation, but the transactions of daily life, the
accountings of merchants, and the purchase and ownership of land were
placed on record. That a phonetic system was rapidly being approached
is manifest from the method by which the Nahua scribes depicted the
names of individuals or cities. These were represented by means of
several objects, the names of which resembled that of the person for
which they stood. The name of King Ixcoatl, for example, is represented
by the drawing of a serpent (<i>coatl</i>) pierced by flint knives
(<i>iztli</i>), and that of Motequauhzoma (Montezuma) by a mouse-trap
(<i>montli</i>), an eagle (<i>quauhtli</i>), a lancet (<i>zo</i>), and
a hand (<i>maitl</i>). The phonetic values employed by the scribes
varied exceedingly, so that at times an entire syllable would be
expressed by the painting of an object the name of which commenced with
it. At other times only a letter would be represented by the same
drawing. But the general intention of the scribes was undoubtedly more
ideographic than phonetic; that is, they desired to convey their
thoughts more by sketch than by sound.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Luckily for future students of Mexican history,
the blind zeal which destroyed the majority of the Mexican manuscripts
was frustrated by the enlightenment of certain European scholars, who
regarded the wholesale destruction of the native records as little
short of a calamity, and who took steps to seek out the few remaining
native artists, from whom they procured copies of the more important
paintings, the details of which were, of course, quite familiar to
them. To those were added interpretations taken down from the lips of
the native scribes themselves, so that no doubt might remain regarding
the contents of the manuscripts. These are known as the
&ldquo;Interpretative Codices,&rdquo; and are of considerable
assistance to the student of Mexican <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>history and customs.
Three only are in existence. The Oxford Codex, treasured in the
Bodleian Library, is of a historical nature, and contains a full list
of the lesser cities which were subservient to Mexico in its palmy
days. The Paris or Tellerio-Remensis Codex, so called from having once
been the property of Le Tellier, Archbishop of Rheims, embodies many
facts concerning the early settlement of the various Nahua city-states.
The Vatican MSS. deal chiefly with mythology and the intricacies of the
Mexican calendar system. Such Mexican paintings as were unassisted by
an interpretation are naturally of less value to present-day students
of the lore of the Nahua. They are principally concerned with calendric
matter, ritualistic data, and astrological computations or
horoscopes.</p>

<p class="par first">Perhaps the most remarkable and interesting
manuscript in the Vatican collection is one the last pages of which
represent the journey of the soul after death through the gloomy
dangers of the Other-world. This has been called the Mexican
&ldquo;Book of the Dead.&rdquo; The corpse is depicted dressed for
burial, the soul escaping from its earthly tenement by way of the
mouth. The spirit is ushered into the presence of Tezcatlipoca, the
Jupiter of the Aztec pantheon, by an attendant dressed in an ocelot
skin, and stands naked with a wooden yoke round the neck before the
deity, to receive sentence. The dead person is given over to the tests
which precede entrance to the abode of the dead, the realm of Mictlan,
and so that he may not have to meet the perils of the journey in a
defenceless condition a sheaf of javelins is bestowed upon him. He
first passes between two lofty peaks, which may fall and crush him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=

serpent then intercepts his path, and, if he succeeds in defeating this
monster, the fierce alligator Xochitonal awaits him. Eight deserts and
a corresponding number of mountains have then to be negotiated by the
hapless spirit, and a whirlwind sharp as a sword, which cuts even
through solid rocks, must be withstood. Accompanied by the shade of his
favourite dog, the harassed ghost at length encounters the fierce
Izpuzteque, a demon with the backward-bent legs of a cock, the evil
Nextepehua, the fiend who scatters clouds of ashes, and many another
grisly foe, until at last he wins to the gates of the Lord of Hell,
before whom he does reverence, after which he is free to greet his

<h3 class="main">The Calendar System</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As has been said, the calendar system was the
source of all Mexican science, and regulated the recurrence of all
religious rites and festivals. In fact, the entire mechanism of Nahua
life was resident in its provisions. The type of time-division and
computation exemplified in the Nahua calendar was also found among the
Maya peoples of Yucatan and Guatemala and the Zapotec people of the
boundary between the Nahua and Maya races. By which of these races it
was first employed is unknown. But the Zapotec calendar exhibits signs
of both Nahua and Maya influence, and from this it has been inferred
that the calendar systems of these races have been evolved from it. It
might with equal probability be argued that both Nahua and Maya art
were offshoots of Zapotec art, because the characteristics of both are
discovered in it, whereas the circumstance merely illustrates the very
natural acceptance by a border people, who settled down to civilisation
at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>relatively later date, of the artistic tenets of
the two greater peoples who environed them. The Nahua and Maya
calendars were in all likelihood evolved from the calendar system of
that civilised race which undoubtedly existed on the Mexican plateau
prior to the coming of the later Nahua swarms, and which in general is
loosely alluded to as the &ldquo;Toltec.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mexican Year</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Mexican year was a cycle of 365 days, without
any intercalary addition or other correction. In course of time it
almost lost its seasonal significance because of the omission of the
extra hours included in the solar year, and furthermore many of its
festivals and occasions were altered by high-priests and rulers to suit
their convenience. The Mexican <i>nexiuhilpililztli</i> (binding of
years) contained fifty-two years, and ran in two separate
cycles&mdash;one of fifty-two years of 365 days each, and another of
seventy-three groups of 260 days each. The first was of course the
solar year, and embraced eighteen periods of twenty days each, called
&ldquo;months&rdquo; by the old Spanish chroniclers, with five
<i>nemontemi</i> (unlucky days) over and above. These days were not
intercalated, but were included in the year, and merely overflowed the
division of the year into periods of twenty days. The cycle of
seventy-three groups of 260 days, subdivided into groups of thirteen
days, was called the &ldquo;birth-cycle.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Lunar Reckoning</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">People in a barbarous condition almost invariably
reckon time by the period between the waxing and waning of the moon as
distinct from the entire passage of a lunar revolution, and this period
of twenty days <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>will be found to be the basis in the
time-reckoning of the Mexicans, who designated it <i>cempohualli</i>.
Each day included in it was denoted by a sign, as &ldquo;house,&rdquo;
&ldquo;snake,&rdquo; &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; and so forth. Each
<i>cempohualli</i> was subdivided into four periods of five days each,
sometimes alluded to as &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; by the early Spanish
writers, and these were known by the sign of their middle or third day.
These day-names ran on without reference to the length of the year. The
year itself was designated by the name of the middle day of the week in
which it began. Out of twenty day-names in the Mexican
&ldquo;month&rdquo; it was inevitable that the four <i>calli</i>
(house), <i>tochtli</i> (rabbit), <i>acatl</i> (reed), and
<i>tecpatl</i> (flint) should always recur in sequence because of the
incidence of these days in the Mexican solar year. Four years made up a
year of the sun. During the <i>nemontemi</i> (unlucky days) no work was
done, as they were regarded as ominous and unwholesome.</p>
<p class="par">We have seen that the civil year permitted the day-names
to run on continuously from one year to another. The ecclesiastical
authorities, however, had a reckoning of their own, and made the year
begin always on the first day of their calendar, no matter what sign
denominated that day in the civil system.</p>

<p class="par first">With the conclusion of each period of fifty-two
years a terrible dread came upon the Mexicans that the world would come
to an end. A stated period of time had expired, a period which was
regarded as fixed by divine command, and it had been ordained that on
the completion of one of those series of fifty-two years earthly time
would cease and the universe be demolished. For some time before the
ceremony of <i>toxilmolpilia</i> (the binding up of the years) the
Mexicans abandoned themselves to the utmost prostration, and the wicked
went about in terrible fear. As the first day of the fifty-third year
dawned the people narrowly observed the Pleiades, for if they passed
the zenith time would proceed and the world would be respited. The gods
were placated or refreshed by the slaughter of the human victim, on
whose still living breast a fire of wood was kindled by friction, the
heart and body being consumed by the flames so lighted. As the planets
of hope crossed the zenith loud acclamations resounded from the people,
and the domestic hearths, which had been left cold and dead, were
rekindled from the sacred fire which had consumed the sacrifice.
Mankind was safe for another period.</p>

ecclesiastical purposes only. The lunar names were abandoned later, and

<h3 class="main">Language of the Nahua</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Nahua language represented a very low state of
culture. Speech is the general measure of the standard of thought of a
people, and if we judged the civilisation of the Nahua by theirs, we
should be justified in concluding that they had not yet emerged from
barbarism. But we must recollect that the Nahua of the conquest period
had speedily adopted the older civilisation which they had found
awaiting them on their entrance to Mexico, and had retained their own
primitive tongue. The older and more cultured people who had preceded
them probably spoke a more polished dialect of the same language, but
its influence had evidently but little effect upon the rude Chichimecs
and Aztecs. The Mexican tongue, like most American languages, belongs
to the &ldquo;incorporative&rdquo; type, the genius of which is to
unite all the related words in a sentence into one conglomerate term or
word, merging the separate words of which it is composed one into
another by altering their forms, and so welding them together as to
express the whole in one word. It will be at once apparent that such a
system was clumsy in the extreme, and led to the creation of words and
names of the most barbarous appearance and sound. In a narrative of the
Spanish discovery written by Chimalpahin, the native chronicler of
Chalco, born in 1579, we have, for example, such a passage as the
following: <i>Oc chiucnauhxihuitl inic onen quilantimanca Espa&ntilde;a
camo niman ic yuh ca omacoc ihuelitiliztli inic niman ye
chiuhcnauhxiuhtica, in oncan ohualla</i>. This passage is chosen quite
at random, and is an average specimen of literary Mexican of the
sixteenth century. Its purport is, freely translated: &ldquo;For nine
years he [Columbus] remained in vain in Spain. Yea, for nine years
there he waited for influence.&rdquo; The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>clumsy and cumbrous
nature of the language could scarcely be better illustrated than by
pointing out that <i>chiucnauhxihuitl</i> signifies &ldquo;nine
years&rdquo;; <i>quilantimanca</i>, &ldquo;he below remained&rdquo;;
and <i>omacoc ihuelitiliztli</i>, &ldquo;he has got his
powerfulness.&rdquo; It must be recollected that this specimen of
Mexican was composed by a person who had had the benefit of a Spanish
education, and is cast in literary form. What the spoken Mexican of
pre-conquest times was like can be contemplated with misgiving in the
grammars of the old Spanish missionaries, whose greatest glory is that
they mastered such a language in the interests of their faith.</p>

<p class="par first">The science of the Aztecs was, perhaps, one
<span class="corr" id="xd22e1428" title="Source: o ">of</span> the most
picturesque sides of their civilisation. As with all peoples in a
semi-barbarous state, it consisted chiefly in astrology and divination.
Of the former the wonderful calendar system was the basis, and by its
aid the priests, or those of them who were set apart for the study of
the heavenly bodies, pretended to be able to tell the future of
new-born infants and the progress of the dead in the other world. This
they accomplished by weighing the influence of the planets and other
luminaries one against another, and extracting the net result. Their
art of divination consisted in drawing omens from the song and flight
of birds, the appearance of grains of seed, feathers, and the entrails
of animals, by which means they confidently predicted both public and
private events.</p>

<h3 class="main">Nahua Government</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The limits of the Aztec Empire may be defined, if
its tributary states are included, as extending over the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>territory comprised in the modern states of
Mexico, Southern Vera Cruz, and Guerrero. Among the civilised peoples
of this extensive tract the prevailing form of government was an
absolute monarchy, although several of the smaller communities were
republics. The law of succession, as with the Celts of Scotland,
prescribed that the eldest surviving brother of the deceased monarch
should be elected to his throne, and, failing him, the eldest nephew.
But incompetent persons were almost invariably ignored by the elective
body, although the choice was limited to one family. The ruler was
generally selected both because of his military prowess and his
ecclesiastical and political knowledge. Indeed, a Mexican monarch was
nearly always a man of the highest culture and artistic refinement, and
the ill-fated Montezuma was an example of the true type of Nahua
sovereign. The council of the monarch was composed of the electors and
other personages of importance in the realm. It undertook the
government of the provinces, the financial affairs of the country, and
other matters of national import. The nobility held all the highest
military, judicial, and ecclesiastical offices. To each city and
province judges were delegated who exercised criminal and civil
jurisdiction, and whose opinion superseded even that of the Crown
itself. Petty cases were settled by lesser officials, and a still
inferior grade of officers acted as a species of police in the
supervision of families.</p>

<h3 class="main">Domestic Life</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The domestic life of the Nahua was a peculiar
admixture of simplicity and display. The mass of the people led a life
of strenuous labour in the fields, and in the cities they wrought hard
at many trades, among which may be specified building, metal-working,
making <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>robes and other articles of bright featherwork and
quilted suits of armour, jewellery, and small wares. Vendors of
flowers, fruit, fish, and vegetables swarmed in the markets. The use of
tobacco was general among the men of all classes. At banquets the women
attended, although they were seated at separate tables. The
entertainments of the upper class were marked by much magnificence, and
the variety of dishes was considerable, including venison, turkey, many
smaller birds, fish, a profusion of vegetables, and pastry, accompanied
by sauces of delicate flavour. These were served in dishes of gold and
silver. <i>Pulque</i>, a fermented drink brewed from the agave, was the
universal beverage. Cannibalism was indulged in usually on ceremonial
occasions, and was surrounded by such refinements of the table as
served only to render it the more repulsive in the eyes of Europeans.
It has been stated that this revolting practice was engaged in owing
solely to the tenets of the Nahua religion, which enjoined the
slaughter of slaves or captives in the name of a deity, and their
consumption with the idea that the consumers attained unity with that
deity in the flesh. But there is good reason to suspect that the Nahua,
deprived of the flesh of the larger domestic animals, practised
deliberate cannibalism. It would appear that the older race which
preceded them in the country were innocent of these horrible
repasts.</p>

Ixtlilxochitl, a native Mexican author, states that it was written by a
Tezcucan wise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=

century, and that it described the pilgrimage of the Nahua from Asia,
their laws, manners, and customs, and their religious tenets, science,
and arts. In 1838 the Baron de Waldeck stated in his <i lang=
"fr">Voyage Pittoresque</i> that he had it in his possession, and the
Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg identified it with the Maya Dresden
Codex and other native manuscripts. Bustamante also states that the
<i>amamatini</i> (chroniclers) of Tezcuco had a copy in their
possession at the time of the taking of their city. But these appear to
be mere surmises, and if the <i>Teo-Amoxtli</i> ever existed, which on

strong leaning toward the marvellous, and has coloured his narratives
so highly that he would have us regard the Toltec or ancient Nahua
civilisations as by far the most splendid and magnificent that ever
existed. His descriptions of Tezcuco, if picturesque in the extreme,
are manifestly the outpourings of a romantic and idealistic mind, which
in its patriotic enthusiasm desired to vindicate the country of his
birth from the stigma of savagery and to prove its equality with the
great nations of antiquity. For this we have not the heart to quarrel

hopeless maze of surmise as to the exact locality of the more famous
centres of Mexican history. A few moments&rsquo; study of this
paragraph will enlighten him in this respect, and will save him much
confusion further on. He will see from the map (p. 330) that the city
of Mexico, or Tenochtitlan, its native name, was situated upon an
island in the Lake of Tezcuco. This lake has now partially dried up,
and the modern city of Mexico is situated at a considerable distance
from it. Tezcuco, the city second in importance, lies to the north-east
of the lake, and is somewhat more isolated, the other <i>pueblos</i>
(towns) clustering round the southern or western shores. To the north
of Tezcuco is Teotihuacan, the sacred city of the gods. To the
south-east of Mexico is Tlaxcallan, or Tlascala, the city which
assisted Cort&eacute;s against the Mexicans, and the inhabitants of
which were the deadliest foes of the central Nahua power. To the north

of the settlement of the Nahua on an agricultural basis a system of
feudal government had evolved, and at various epochs in the history of
the country certain cities or groups of cities held a paramount sway.
Subsequent to the &ldquo;Toltec&rdquo; period, which we have already
described and discussed, we find the Acolhuans in supreme power, and
ruling from their cities of Tollantzinco and Cholula a considerable
tract of country. Later Cholula maintained an alliance with Tlascala
and Huexotzinco.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The maxim &ldquo;Other climes, other
manners&rdquo; is nowhere better exemplified than by the curious annual
strife betwixt the warriors of Mexico and Tlascala. Once a year they
met on a prearranged battle-ground and engaged in combat, not with the
intention of killing one another, but with the object of taking
prisoners for sacrifice on the altars of their respective war-gods. The
warrior seized his opponent and attempted to bear him off, the various
groups pulling and tugging desperately at each other in the endeavour
to seize the limbs of the unfortunate who had been first struck down,
with the object of dragging him into durance or effecting his rescue.
Once secured, the Tlascaltec warrior was brought to Mexico in a cage,
and first placed upon a stone slab, to which one of his feet was
secured by a chain or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>thong. He was then given light weapons, more
like playthings than warrior&rsquo;s gear, and confronted by one of the
most celebrated Mexican warriors. Should he succeed in defeating six of
these formidable antagonists, he was set free. But no sooner was he
wounded than he was hurried to the altar of sacrifice, and his heart
was torn out and offered to Huitzilopochtli, the implacable god of
war.</p>
<p class="par">The Tlascaltecs, having finally secured their position
by a defeat of the Tecpanecs of Huexotzinco about <span class=

the valley of Mexico now command our attention. More than two score of
these thriving communities flourished at the time of the conquest of
Mexico, the most notable being those which occupied the borders of the
Lake of Tezcuco. These cities grouped themselves round two nuclei,
Azcapozalco and Tezcuco, between whom a fierce rivalry sprang up, which
finally ended in the entire discomfiture or Azcapozalco. From this
event the real history of Mexico may be said to commence. Those cities
which had allied themselves to Tezcuco finally overran the entire
territory of Mexico from the Mexican Gulf to the Pacific.</p>

had assisted that city to supremacy. Among these was Xaltocan, a
city-state of unquestionable Otomi origin, situated at the northern
extremity of the lake. As we have seen from the statements of
Ixtlilxochitl, a Tezcucan writer, his native city was in the forefront
of Nahua civilisation at the time of the coming of the Spaniards, and
if it was practically subservient to Mexico (Tenochtitlan) at that
period it was by no means its inferior in the arts.</p>

Their state was probably founded about the twelfth century, although a
chronology of no less than fifteen hundred years was claimed for it.
This people composed a sort of buffer-state betwixt the Otomi on the
north and other Nahua on the south.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The menace of these northern Otomi had become
acute when the Tecpanecs received reinforcements in the shape of the
Aztec&acirc;, or Aztecs, a people of Nahua blood, who came, according
to their own accounts, from Aztlan (Crane Land). The name Aztec&acirc;
signifies &ldquo;Crane People,&rdquo; and this has led to the
assumption that they came from Chihuahua, where cranes abound. Doubts
have been cast upon the Nahua origin of the Aztec&acirc;. But these are
by no means well founded, as the names of the early Aztec chieftains
and kings are unquestionably Nahuan. This people on their arrival in
Mexico were in a very inferior state of culture, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>were
probably little better than savages. We have already outlined some of
the legends concerning the coming of the Aztecs to the land of Anahuac,
or the valley of Mexico, but their true origin is uncertain, and it is
likely that they wandered down from the north as other Nahua immigrants
did before them, and as the Apache Indians still do to this day. By
their own showing they had sojourned at several points <i lang="fr">en
route</i>, and were reduced to slavery by the chiefs of Colhuacan. They
proved so truculent in their bondage, however, that they were released,
and journeyed to Chapoultepec, which they quitted because of their
dissensions with the Xaltocanecs. On their arrival in the district
inhabited by the Tecpanecs a tribute was levied upon them, but
nevertheless they flourished so exceedingly that the swamp villages
which the Tecpanecs had permitted them to raise on the borders of the
lake soon grew into thriving communities, and chiefs were provided for
them from among the nobility of the Tecpanecs.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Aztecs as Allies</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By the aid of the Aztecs the Tecpanecs greatly
extended their territorial possessions. City after city was added to
their empire, and the allies finally invaded the Otomi country, which
they speedily subdued. Those cities which had been founded by the
Acolhuans on the fringes of Tezcuco also allied themselves with the
Tecpanecs with the intention of freeing themselves from the yoke of the
Chichimecs, whose hand was heavy upon them. The Chichimecs or Tezcucans
made a stern resistance, and for a time the sovereignty of the
Tecpanecs hung in the balance. But eventually they conquered, and
Tezcuco was overthrown and given as a spoil to the Aztecs. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Up to this time the Aztecs had paid a tribute to
Azcapozalco, but now, strengthened by the successes of the late
conflict, they withheld it, and requested permission to build an
aqueduct from the shore for the purpose of carrying a supply of water
into their city. This was refused by the Tecpanecs, and a policy of
isolation was brought to bear upon Mexico, an embargo being placed upon
its goods and intercourse with its people being forbidden. War
followed, in which the Tecpanecs were defeated with great slaughter.
After this event, which may be placed about the year 1428, the Aztecs
gained ground rapidly, and their march to the supremacy of the entire
Mexican valley was almost undisputed. Allying themselves with Tezcuco
and Tlacopan, the Mexicans overran many states far beyond the confines
of the valley, and by the time of Montezuma I had extended their
boundaries almost to the limits of the present republic. The Mexican
merchant followed in the footsteps of the Mexican warrior, and the
commercial expansion of the Aztecs rivalled their military fame. Clever
traders, they were merciless in their exactions of tribute from the
states they conquered, manufacturing the raw material paid to them by
the subject cities into goods which they afterwards sold again to the
tribes under their sway. Mexico became the chief market of the empire,
as well as its political nucleus. Such was the condition of affairs
when the Spaniards arrived in Anahuac. Their coming has been deplored
by certain historians as hastening the destruction of a Western Eden.
But bad as was their rule, it was probably mild when compared with the
cruel and insatiable sway of the Aztecs over their unhappy dependents.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>The Spaniards found a tyrannical despotism in the
conquered provinces, and a faith the accessories of which were so
fiendish that it cast a gloom over the entire national life. These they
replaced by a milder vassalage and the earnest ministrations of a more
enlightened priesthood.</p>

<h3 class="main">Nahua Religion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The religion of the ancient Mexicans was a
polytheism or worship of a pantheon of deities, the general aspect of
which presented similarities to the systems of Greece and Egypt.
Original influences, however, were strong, and they are especially
discernible in the institutions of ritualistic cannibalism and human
sacrifice. Strange resemblances to Christian practice were observed in
the Aztec mythology by the Spanish Conquistadores, who piously
condemned the native customs of baptism, consubstantiation, and
confession as frauds founded and perpetuated by diabolic agency.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">A superficial examination of the Nahua religion might
lead to the inference that within its scope and system no definite
theological views were embraced and no ethical principles propounded,
and that the entire mythology presents only the fantastic attitude of
the barbarian mind toward the eternal verities. Such a conclusion would
be both erroneous and unjust to a human intelligence of a type by no
means debased. As a matter of fact, the Nahua displayed a theological
advancement greatly superior to that of the Greeks or Romans, and quite
on a level with that expressed by the Egyptians and Assyrians. Toward
the period of the Spanish occupation the Mexican priesthood was
undoubtedly advancing to the contemplation of the exaltation of one
god, whose worship was fast excluding that of similar deities, and if
our data are too imperfect to allow us to speak very fully in regard to
this phase of religious advancement, we know at least that much of the
Nahua ritual and many of the prayers preserved by the labours of the
Spanish fathers are unquestionably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>genuine, and display the
attainment of a high religious level.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Cosmology</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Aztec theology postulated an eternity which,
however, was not without its epochs. It was thought to be broken up
into a number of &aelig;ons, each of which depended upon the period of
duration of a separate &ldquo;sun.&rdquo; No agreement is noticeable
among authorities on Mexican mythology as to the number of these
&ldquo;suns,&rdquo; but it would appear as probable that the favourite
tradition stipulated for four &ldquo;suns&rdquo; or epochs, each of
which concluded with a national disaster&mdash;flood, famine, tempest,
or fire. The present &aelig;on, they feared, might conclude upon the
completion of every &ldquo;sheaf&rdquo; of fifty-two years, the
&ldquo;sheaf&rdquo; being a merely arbitrary portion of an &aelig;on.
The period of time from the first creation to the current &aelig;on was
variously computed as 15,228, 2386, or 1404 solar years, the
discrepancy and doubt arising because of the equivocal nature of the
numeral signs expressing the period in the <i lang="es">pinturas</i> or
native paintings. As regards the sequence of &ldquo;suns&rdquo; there
is no more agreement than there is regarding their number. The Codex
Vaticanus states it to have been water, wind, fire, and famine.
Humboldt gives it as hunger, fire, wind, and water; Boturini as water,
famine, wind, and fire; and Gama as hunger, wind, fire, and water.</p>
<p class="par">In all likelihood the adoption of four ages arose from
the sacred nature of that number. The myth doubtless shaped itself upon
the <i>tonalamatl</i> (Mexican native calendar), the great repository
of the wisdom of the Nahua race, which the priestly class regarded as
its <i lang="la">vade mecum</i>, and which was closely consulted by it
on every occasion, civil or religious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Sources of Mexican Mythology</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Our knowledge of the mythology of the Mexicans is
chiefly gained through the works of those Spaniards, lay and cleric,
who entered the country along with or immediately subsequent to the
Spanish Conquistadores. From several of these we have what might be
called first-hand accounts of the theogony and ritual of the Nahua
people. The most valuable compendium is that of Father Bernardino
Sahagun, entitled <i>A General History of the Affairs of New Spain</i>,
which was published from manuscript only in the middle of last century,
though written in the first half of the sixteenth century. Sahagun
arrived in Mexico eight years after the country had been reduced by the
Spaniards to a condition of servitude. He obtained a thorough mastery
of the Nahuatl tongue, and conceived a warm admiration for the native
mind and a deep interest in the antiquities of the conquered people.
His method of collecting facts concerning their mythology and history
was as effective as it was ingenious. He held daily conferences with
reliable Indians, and placed questions before them, to which they
replied by symbolical paintings detailing the answers which he
required. These he submitted to scholars who had been trained under his
own supervision, and who, after consultation among themselves, rendered
him a criticism in Nahuatl of the hieroglyphical paintings he had
placed at their disposal. Not content with this process, he subjected
these replies to the criticism of a third body, after which the matter
was included in his work. But ecclesiastical intolerance was destined
to keep the work from publication for a couple of centuries. Afraid
that such a volume would be successful in keeping alight the fires of
paganism in Mexico, Sahagun&rsquo;s brethren <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>refused
him the assistance he required for its publication. But on his
appealing to the Council of the Indies in Spain he was met with
encouragement, and was ordered to translate his great work into
Spanish, a task he undertook when over eighty years of age. He
transmitted the work to Spain, and for three hundred years nothing more
was heard of it.</p>

<p class="par first">For generations antiquarians interested in the
lore of ancient Mexico bemoaned its loss, until at length one
Mu&ntilde;oz, more indefatigable than the rest, chanced to visit the
crumbling library of the ancient convent of Tolosi, in Navarre. There,
among time-worn manuscripts and tomes relating to the early fathers and
the intricacies of canon law, he discovered the lost Sahagun! It was
printed separately by Bustamante at Mexico and by Lord Kingsborough in
his collection in 1830, and has been translated into French by M.
Jourdanet. Thus the manuscript commenced in or after 1530 was given to
the public after a lapse of no less than three hundred years!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Father Torquemada arrived in the New World about
the middle of the sixteenth century, at which period he was still
enabled to take from the lips of such of the Conquistadores as remained
much curious information regarding the circumstances of their advent.
His <i lang="es">Monarchia Indiana</i> was first published at Seville
in 1615, and in it he made much use of the manuscript of Sahagun, not
then published. At the same time his observations upon matters
pertaining to the native religion are often illuminating and
exhaustive.</p>
<p class="par">In his <i lang="es">Storia Antica del Messico</i> the
Abb&eacute; Clavigero, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span>who published his work in 1780, did much to
disperse the clouds of tradition which hung over Mexican history and
mythology. The clarity of his style and the exactness of his
information render his work exceedingly useful.</p>
<p class="par">Antonio Gama, in his <i lang="es">Descripcion Historica
y Cronologica de las dos Piedras</i>, poured a flood of light on
Mexican antiquities. His work was published in 1832. With him may be
said to have ceased the line of Mexican arch&aelig;ologists of the
older school. Others worthy of being mentioned among the older writers
on Mexican mythology (we are not here concerned with history) are
Boturini, who, in his <i lang="es">Idea de una Nueva Historia General
de la America Septentrional</i>, gives a vivid picture of native life
and tradition, culled from first-hand communication with the people;
Ixtlilxochitl, a half-breed, whose mendacious works, the <i lang=
"es">Relaciones</i> and <i lang="es">Historia Chichimeca</i>, are yet
valuable repositories of tradition; Jos&eacute; de Acosta, whose
<i lang="es">Historia Natural y Moral de las Yndias</i> was published
at Seville in 1580; and Gomara, who, in his <i lang="es">Historia
General de las Indias</i> (Madrid, 1749), rested upon the authority of
the Conquistadores. Tezozomoc&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Chronica
Mexicana</i>, reproduced in Lord Kingsborough&rsquo;s great work, is
valuable as giving unique facts regarding the Aztec mythology, as is
the <i lang="es">Teatro Mexicana</i> of Vetancurt, published at Mexico
in 1697&ndash;98.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Worship of One God</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The ritual of this dead faith of another
hemisphere abounds in expressions concerning the unity of the deity
approaching very nearly to many of those we ourselves employ regarding
God&rsquo;s attributes. The various classes of the priesthood were in
the habit of addressing the several gods to whom they ministered as
&ldquo;omnipotent,&rdquo; &ldquo;endless,&rdquo;
&ldquo;invisible,&rdquo; &ldquo;the one god complete in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>perfection and unity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Maker
and Moulder of All.&rdquo; These appellations they applied not to one
supreme being, but to the individual deities to whose service they were
attached. It may be thought that such a practice would be fatal to the
evolution of a single and universal god. But there is every reason to
believe that Tezcatlipoca, the great god of the air, like the Hebrew
Jahveh, also an air-god, was fast gaining precedence of all other
deities, when the coming of the white man put an end to his chances of
sovereignty.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Tezcatlipoca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tezcatlipoca (Fiery Mirror) was undoubtedly the
Jupiter of the Nahua pantheon. He carried a mirror or shield, from
which he took his name, and in which he was supposed to see reflected
the actions and deeds of mankind. The evolution of this god from the
status of a spirit of wind or air to that of the supreme deity of the
Aztec people presents many points of deep interest to students of
mythology. Originally the personification of the air, the source both
of the breath of life and of the tempest, Tezcatlipoca possessed all
the attributes of a god who presided over these phenomena. As the
tribal god of the Tezcucans who had led them into the Land of Promise,
and had been instrumental in the defeat of both the gods and men of the
elder race they dispossessed, Tezcatlipoca naturally advanced so
speedily in popularity and public honour that it was little wonder that
within a comparatively short space of time he came to be regarded as a
god of fate and fortune, and as inseparably connected with the national
destinies. Thus, from being the peculiar deity of a small band of Nahua
immigrants, the prestige accruing from the rapid conquest made under
his tutelary direction and the speedily disseminated tales of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>prowess of those who worshipped him seemed to
render him at once the most popular and the best feared god in Anahuac,
therefore the one whose cult quickly overshadowed that of other and
similar gods.</p>

<p class="par first">We find Tezcatlipoca intimately associated with
the legends which recount the overthrow of Tollan, the capital of the
Toltecs. His chief adversary on the Toltec side is the god-king
Quetzalcoatl, whose nature and reign we will consider later, but whom
we will now merely regard as the enemy of Tezcatlipoca. The rivalry
between these gods symbolises that which existed between the civilised
Toltecs and the barbarian Nahua, and is well exemplified in the
following myths.</p>

<h3 class="main">Myths of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the days of Quetzalcoatl there was abundance of
everything necessary for subsistence. The maize was plentiful, the
calabashes were as thick as one&rsquo;s arm, and cotton grew in all
colours without having to be dyed. A variety of birds of rich plumage
filled the air with their songs, and gold, silver, and precious stones
were abundant. In the reign of Quetzalcoatl there was peace and plenty
for all men.</p>
<p class="par">But this blissful state was too fortunate, too happy to
endure. Envious of the calm enjoyment of the god and his people the
Toltecs, three wicked &ldquo;necromancers&rdquo; plotted their
downfall. The reference is of course to the gods of the invading Nahua
tribes, the deities Huitzilopochtli, Titlacahuan or Tezcatlipoca, and
Tlacahuepan. These laid evil enchantments upon the city of Tollan, and
Tezcatlipoca in particular took the lead in these envious conspiracies.
Disguised as an aged man with white hair, he presented himself at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>the palace of Quetzalcoatl, where he said to the
pages-in-waiting: &ldquo;Pray present me to your master the king. I
desire to speak with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The pages advised him to retire, as Quetzalcoatl was
indisposed and could see no one. He requested them, however, to tell
the god that he was waiting outside. They did so, and procured his
admittance.</p>
<p class="par">On entering the chamber of Quetzalcoatl the wily
Tezcatlipoca simulated much sympathy with the suffering god-king.
&ldquo;How are you, my son?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have brought you
a drug which you should drink, and which will put an end to the course
of your malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are welcome, old man,&rdquo; replied
Quetzalcoatl. &ldquo;I have known for many days that you would come. I
am exceedingly indisposed. The malady affects my entire system, and I
can use neither my hands nor feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tezcatlipoca assured him that if he partook of the
medicine which he had brought him he would immediately experience a
great improvement in health. Quetzalcoatl drank the potion, and at once
felt much revived. The cunning Tezcatlipoca pressed another and still
another cup of the potion upon him, and as it was nothing but
<i>pulque</i>, the wine of the country, he speedily became intoxicated,
and was as wax in the hands of his adversary.</p>

<p class="par first">Tezcatlipoca, in pursuance of his policy inimical
to the Toltec state, took the form of an Indian of the name of Toueyo
(Toveyo), and bent his steps to the palace of Uemac, chief of the
Toltecs in temporal matters. This worthy had a daughter so fair that
she was desired in marriage by many of the Toltecs, but all to no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=

all. The princess, beholding the false Toueyo passing her
father&rsquo;s palace, fell deeply in love with him, and so tumultuous
was her passion that she became seriously ill because of her longing
for him. Uemac, hearing of her indisposition, bent his steps to her
apartments, and inquired of her women the cause of her illness. They
told him that it was occasioned by the sudden passion which had seized
her for the Indian who had recently come that way. Uemac at once gave
orders for the arrest of Toueyo, and he was haled before the temporal
chief of Tollan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo; inquired Uemac of his
prisoner, who was very scantily attired.</p>

disgracing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Slay me; I care not,&rdquo; said the cunning
Tezcatlipoca.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Uemac, &ldquo;for if I slay
you my daughter will perish. Go to her and say that she may wed you and
be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par">Now the marriage of Toueyo to the daughter of Uemac
aroused much discontent among the Toltecs; and they murmured among
themselves, and said: &ldquo;Wherefore did Uemac give his daughter to
this Toueyo?&rdquo; Uemac, having got wind of these murmurings,
resolved to distract the attention of the Toltecs by making war upon
the neighbouring state of Coatepec. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>The Toltecs assembled armed for
the fray, and having arrived at the country of the men of Coatepec they
placed Toueyo in ambush with his body-servants, hoping that he would be
slain by their adversaries. But Toueyo and his men killed a large
number of the enemy and put them to flight. His triumph was celebrated
by Uemac with much pomp. The knightly plumes were placed upon his head,
and his body was painted with red and yellow&mdash;an honour reserved
for those who distinguished themselves in battle.</p>
<p class="par">Tezcatlipoca&rsquo;s next step was to announce a great
feast in Tollan, to which all the people for miles around were invited.
Great crowds assembled, and danced and sang in the city to the sound of
the drum. Tezcatlipoca sang to them and forced them to accompany the
rhythm of his song with their feet. Faster and faster the people
danced, until the pace became so furious that they were driven to
madness, lost their footing, and tumbled pell-mell down a deep ravine,
where they were changed into rocks. Others in attempting to cross a
stone bridge precipitated themselves into the water below, and were
changed into stones.</p>
<p class="par">On another occasion Tezcatlipoca presented himself as a
valiant warrior named Tequiua, and invited all the inhabitants of
Tollan and its environs to come to the flower-garden called Xochitla.
When assembled there he attacked them with a hoe, and slew a great
number, and others in panic crushed their comrades to death.</p>
<p class="par">Tezcatlipoca and Tlacahuepan on another occasion
repaired to the market-place of Tollan, the former displaying upon the
palm of his hand a small infant whom he caused to dance and to cut the
most amusing capers. This infant was in reality Huitzilopochtli, the
Nahua god of war. At this sight the Toltecs crowded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>upon one
another for the purpose of getting a better view, and their eagerness
resulted in many being crushed to death. So enraged were the Toltecs at
this that upon the advice of Tlacahuepan they slew both Tezcatlipoca
and Huitzilopochtli. When this had been done the bodies of the slain
gods gave forth such a pernicious effluvia that thousands of the
Toltecs died of the pestilence. The god Tlacahuepan then advised them
to cast out the bodies lest worse befell them, but on their attempting
to do so they discovered their weight to be so great that they could
not move them. Hundreds wound cords round the corpses, but the strands
broke, and those who pulled upon them fell and died suddenly, tumbling
one upon the other, and suffocating those upon whom they collapsed.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Departure of Quetzalcoatl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Toltecs were so tormented by the enchantments
of Tezcatlipoca that it was soon apparent to them that their fortunes
were on the wane and that the end of their empire was at hand.
Quetzalcoatl, chagrined at the turn things had taken, resolved to quit
Tollan and go to the country of Tlapallan, whence he had come on his
civilising mission to Mexico. He burned all the houses which he had
built, and buried his treasure of gold and precious stones in the deep
valleys between the mountains. He changed the cacao-trees into
mezquites, and he ordered all the birds of rich plumage and song to
quit the valley of Anahuac and to follow him to a distance of more than
a hundred leagues. On the road from Tollan he discovered a great tree
at a point called Quauhtitlan. There he rested, and requested his pages
to hand him a mirror. Regarding himself in the polished surface, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I am old,&rdquo; and from that circumstance the spot
was named Huehuequauhtitlan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>(Old Quauhtitlan). Proceeding on his
way accompanied by musicians who played the flute, he walked until
fatigue arrested his steps, and he seated himself upon a stone, on
which he left the imprint of his hands. This place is called Temacpalco
(The Impress of the Hands). At Coaapan he was met by the Nahua gods,
who were inimical to him and to the Toltecs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where do you go?&rdquo; they asked him.
&ldquo;Why do you leave your capital?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I go to Tlapallan,&rdquo; replied Quetzalcoatl,
&ldquo;whence I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; persisted the
enchanters.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My father the Sun has called me thence,&rdquo;
replied Quetzalcoatl.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go, then, happily,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but
leave us the secret of your art, the secret of founding in silver, of
working in precious stones and woods, of painting, and of
feather-working, and other matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Quetzalcoatl refused, and cast all his treasures
into the fountain of Cozcaapa (Water of Precious Stones). At Cochtan he
was met by another enchanter, who asked him whither he was bound, and
on learning his destination proffered him a draught of wine. On tasting
the vintage Quetzalcoatl was overcome with sleep. Continuing his
journey in the morning, the god passed between a volcano and the Sierra
Nevada (Mountain of Snow), where all the pages who accompanied him died
of cold. He regretted this misfortune exceedingly, and wept, lamenting
their fate with most bitter tears and mournful songs. On reaching the
summit of Mount Poyauhtecatl he slid to the base. Arriving at the
sea-shore, he embarked upon a raft of serpents, and was wafted away
toward the land of Tlapallan.</p>
<p class="par">It is obvious that these legends bear some resemblance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=

of the Toltecs. They are taken from Sahagun&rsquo;s work, <i lang=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tezcatlipoca was much more than a mere
personification of wind, and if he was regarded as a life-giver he had
also the power of destroying existence. In fact on occasion he appears
as an inexorable death-dealer, and as such was styled Nezahualpilli
(The Hungry Chief) and Yaotzin (The Enemy). Perhaps one of the names by
which he was best known was Telpochtli (The Youthful Warrior), from the
fact that his reserve of strength, his vital force, never diminished,
and that his youthful and boisterous vigour was apparent in the
tempest.</p>
<p class="par">Tezcatlipoca was usually depicted as holding in his
right hand a dart placed in an <i>atlatl</i> (spear-thrower), and his
mirror-shield with four spare darts in his left. This shield is the
symbol of his power as judge of mankind and upholder of human
justice.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Tezcatlipoca, Lord of the Night Winds</p>
<p class="par first">Gilbert James</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Aztecs pictured Tezcatlipoca as rioting along the
highways in search of persons on whom to wreak his vengeance, as the
wind of night rushes along the deserted roads with more seeming
violence than it does by day. Indeed one of his names, Yoalli Ehecatl,
signifies &ldquo;Night Wind.&rdquo; Benches of stone, shaped like those
made for the dignitaries of the Mexican towns, were distributed along
the highways for his especial use, that on these he might rest after
his boisterous journeyings. These seats were concealed by green boughs,
beneath which the god was supposed to lurk in wait for his victims. But
if one of the persons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>he seized overcame him in the struggle he
might ask whatever boon he desired, secure in the promise of the deity
that it should be granted forthwith.</p>
<p class="par">It was supposed that Tezcatlipoca had guided the Nahua,
and especially the people of Tezcuco, from a more northerly clime to
the valley of Mexico. But he was not a mere local deity of Tezcuco, his
worship being widely celebrated throughout the country. His exalted
position in the Mexican pantheon seems to have won for him especial
reverence as a god of fate and fortune. The place he took as the head
of the Nahua pantheon brought him many attributes which were quite
foreign to his original character. Fear and a desire to exalt their
tutelar deity will impel the devotees of a powerful god to credit him
with any or every quality, so that there is nothing remarkable in the
spectacle of the heaping of every possible attribute, human or divine,
upon Tezcatlipoca when we recall the supreme position he occupied in
Mexican mythology. His priestly caste far surpassed in power and in the
breadth and activity of its propaganda the priesthoods of the other
Mexican deities. To it is credited the invention of many of the usages
of civilisation, and that it all but succeeded in making his worship
universal is pretty clear, as has been shown. The other gods were
worshipped for some special purpose, but the worship of Tezcatlipoca
was regarded as compulsory, and to some extent as a safeguard against
the destruction of the universe, a calamity the Nahua had been led to
believe might occur through his agency. He was known as Moneneque (The
Claimer of Prayer), and in some of the representations of him an ear of
gold was shown suspended from his hair, toward which small tongues of
gold strained upward in appeal of prayer. In times of national danger,
plague, or famine universal prayer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>was made to Tezcatlipoca. The
heads of the community repaired to his <i>teocalli</i> (temple)
accompanied by the people <i>en masse</i>, and all prayed earnestly
together for his speedy intervention. The prayers to Tezcatlipoca still
extant prove that the ancient Mexicans fully believed that he possessed
the power of life and death, and many of them are couched in the most
piteous terms.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Teotleco Festival</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The supreme position occupied by Tezcatlipoca in
the Mexican religion is well exemplified in the festival of the
Teotleco (Coming of the Gods), which is fully described in
Sahagun&rsquo;s account of the Mexican festivals. Another peculiarity
connected with his worship was that he was one of the few Mexican
deities who had any relation to the expiation of sin. Sin was
symbolised by the Nahua as excrement, and in various manuscripts
Tezcatlipoca is represented as a turkey-cock to which ordure is being
offered up.</p>
<p class="par">Of the festival of the Teotleco Sahagun says: &ldquo;In
the twelfth month a festival was celebrated in honour of all the gods,
who were said to have gone to some country I know not where. On the
last day of the month a greater one was held, because the gods had
returned. On the fifteenth day of this month the young boys and the
servitors decked all the altars or oratories of the gods with boughs,
as well as those which were in the houses, and the images which were
set up by the wayside and at the cross-roads. This work was paid for in
maize. Some received a basketful, and others only a few ears. On the
eighteenth day the ever-youthful god Tlamatzincatl or Titlacahuan
arrived. It was said that he marched better and arrived the first
because he was strong and young. Food was offered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>him in
his temple on that night. Every one drank, ate, and made merry. The old
people especially celebrated the arrival of the god by drinking wine,
and it was alleged that his feet were washed by these rejoicings. The
last day of the month was marked by a great festival, on account of the
belief that the whole of the gods arrived at that time. On the
preceding night a quantity of flour was kneaded on a carpet into the
shape of a cheese, it being supposed that the gods would leave a
footprint thereon as a sign of their return. The chief attendant
watched all night, going to and fro to see if the impression appeared.
When he at last saw it he called out, &lsquo;The master has
arrived,&rsquo; and at once the priests of the temple began to sound
the horns, trumpets, and other musical instruments used by them. Upon
hearing this noise every one set forth to offer food in all the
temples.&rdquo; The next day the aged gods were supposed to arrive, and
young men disguised as monsters hurled victims into a huge sacrificial
fire.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Toxcatl Festival</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The most remarkable festival in connection with
Tezcatlipoca was the Toxcatl, held in the fifth month. On the day of
this festival a youth was slain who for an entire year previously had
been carefully instructed in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of victim. He was
selected from among the best war captives of the year, and must be
without spot or blemish. He assumed the name, garb, and attributes of
Tezcatlipoca himself, and was regarded with awe by the entire populace,
who imagined him to be the earthly representative of the deity. He
rested during the day, and ventured forth at night only, armed with the
dart and shield of the god, to scour the roads. This practice was, of
course, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>symbolical of the wind-god&rsquo;s progress over
the night-bound highways. He carried also the whistle symbolical of the
deity, and made with it a noise such as the weird wind of night makes
when it hurries through the streets. To his arms and legs small bells
were attached. He was followed by a retinue of pages, and at intervals
rested upon the stone seats which were placed upon the highways for the
convenience of Tezcatlipoca. Later in the year he was mated to four
beautiful maidens of high birth, with whom he passed the time in
amusement of every description. He was entertained at the tables of the
nobility as the earthly representative of Tezcatlipoca, and his latter
days were one constant round of feasting and excitement. At last the
fatal day upon which he must be sacrificed arrived. He took a tearful
farewell of the maidens whom he had espoused, and was carried to the
<i>teocalli</i> of sacrifice, upon the sides of which he broke the
musical instruments with which he had beguiled the time of his
captivity. When he reached the summit he was received by the
high-priest, who speedily made him one with the god whom he represented
by tearing his heart out on the stone of sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class="main">Huitzilopochtli, the War-God</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Huitzilopochtli occupied in the Aztec pantheon a
place similar to that of Mars in the Roman. His origin is obscure, but
the myth relating to it is distinctly original in character. It
recounts how, under the shadow of the mountain of Coatepec, near the
Toltec city of Tollan, there dwelt a pious widow called Coatlicue, the
mother of a tribe of Indians called Centzonuitznaua, who had a daughter
called Coyolxauhqui, and who daily repaired to a small hill with the
intention of offering up prayers to the gods in a penitent spirit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>of piety. Whilst occupied in her devotions one day
she was surprised by a small ball of brilliantly coloured feathers
falling upon her from on high. She was pleased by the bright variety of
its hues, and placed it in her bosom, intending to offer it up to the
sun-god. Some time afterwards she learnt that she was to become the
mother of another child. Her sons, hearing of this, rained abuse upon
her, being incited to humiliate her in every possible way by their
sister Coyolxauhqui.</p>
<p class="par">Coatlicue went about in fear and anxiety; but the spirit
of her unborn infant came and spoke to her and gave her words of
encouragement, soothing her troubled heart. Her sons, however, were
resolved to wipe out what they considered an insult to their race by
the death of their mother, and took counsel with one another to slay
her. They attired themselves in their war-gear, and arranged their hair
after the manner of warriors going to battle. But one of their number,
Quauitlicac, relented, and confessed the perfidy of his brothers to the
still unborn Huitzilopochtli, who replied to him: &ldquo;O brother,
hearken attentively to what I have to say to you. I am fully informed
of what is about to happen.&rdquo; With the intention of slaying their
mother, the Indians went in search of her. At their head marched their
sister, Coyolxauhqui. They were armed to the teeth, and carried bundles
of darts with which they intended to kill the luckless Coatlicue.</p>
<p class="par">Quauitlicac climbed the mountain to acquaint
Huitzilopochtli with the news that his brothers were approaching to
kill their mother.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mark well where they are at,&rdquo; replied the
infant god. &ldquo;To what place have they advanced?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To Tzompantitlan,&rdquo; responded
Quauitlicac.</p>
<p class="par">Later on Huitzilopochtli asked: &ldquo;Where may they be
now?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At Coaxalco,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p class="par">Once more Huitzilopochtli asked to what point his
enemies had advanced.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are now at Petlac,&rdquo; Quauitlicac
replied.</p>
<p class="par">After a little while Quauitlicac informed
Huitzilopochtli that the Centzonuitznaua were at hand under the
leadership of Coyolxauhqui. At the moment of the enemy&rsquo;s arrival
Huitzilopochtli was born, flourishing a shield and spear of a blue
colour. He was painted, his head was surmounted by a panache, and his
left leg was covered with feathers. He shattered Coyolxauhqui with a
flash of serpentine lightning, and then gave chase to the
Centzonuitznaua, whom he pursued four times round the mountain. They
did not attempt to defend themselves, but fled incontinently. Many
perished in the waters of the adjoining lake, to which they had rushed
in their despair. All were slain save a few who escaped to a place
called Uitzlampa, where they surrendered to Huitzilopochtli and gave up
their arms.</p>
<p class="par">The name Huitzilopochtli signifies &ldquo;Humming-bird
to the left,&rdquo; from the circumstance that the god wore the
feathers of the humming-bird, or <i>colibri</i>, on his left leg. From
this it has been inferred that he was a humming-bird totem. The
explanation of Huitzilopochtli&rsquo;s origin is a little deeper than
this, however. Among the American tribes, especially those of the
northern continent, the serpent is regarded with the deepest veneration
as the symbol of wisdom and magic. From these sources come success in
war. The serpent also typifies the lightning, the symbol of the divine
spear, the apotheosis of warlike might. Fragments of serpents are
regarded as powerful war-physic among many tribes. Atatarho, a mythical
wizard-king of the Iroquois, was clothed with living serpents as with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>robe, and his myth throws light on one of the
names of Huitzilopochtli&rsquo;s mother, Coatlantona (Robe of
Serpents). Huitzilopochtli&rsquo;s image was surrounded by serpents,
and rested on serpent-shaped supporters. His sceptre was a single
snake, and his great drum was of serpent-skin.</p>
<p class="par">In American mythology the serpent is closely associated
with the bird. Thus the name of the god Quetzalcoatl is translatable as
&ldquo;Feathered Serpent,&rdquo; and many similar cases where the
conception of bird and serpent have been unified could be adduced.
Huitzilopochtli is undoubtedly one of these. We may regard him as a god
the primary conception of whom arose from the idea of the serpent, the
symbol of warlike wisdom and might, the symbol of the warrior&rsquo;s
dart or spear, and the humming-bird, the harbinger of summer, type of
the season when the snake or lightning god has power over the
crops.</p>
<p class="par">Huitzilopochtli was usually represented as wearing on
his head a waving panache or plume of humming-birds&rsquo; feathers.
His face and limbs were striped with bars of blue, and in his right
hand he carried four spears. His left hand bore his shield, on the
surface of which were displayed five tufts of down, arranged in the
form of a quincunx. The shield was made with reeds, covered with
eagle&rsquo;s down. The spear he brandished was also tipped with tufts
of down instead of flint. These weapons were placed in the hands of
those who as captives engaged in the sacrificial fight, for in the
Aztec mind Huitzilopochtli symbolised the warrior&rsquo;s death on the
gladiatorial stone of combat. As has been said, Huitzilopochtli was
war-god of the Aztecs, and was supposed to have led them to the site of
Mexico from their original home in the north. The city of Mexico took
its name from one of its districts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>which was designated by a title
of Huitzilopochtli&rsquo;s, Mexitli (Hare of the Aloes).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd22e1892" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The War-God as Fertiliser</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But Huitzilopochtli was not a war-god alone. As
the serpent-god of lightning he had a connection with summer, the
season of lightning, and therefore had dominion to some extent over the
crops and fruits of the earth. The Algonquian Indians of North America
believed that the rattlesnake could raise ruinous storms or grant
favourable breezes. They alluded to it also as the symbol of life, for
the serpent has a phallic significance because of its similarity to the
symbol of generation and fructification. With some American tribes
also, notably the Pueblo Indians of Arizona, the serpent has a solar
significance, and with tail in mouth symbolises the annual round of the
sun. The Nahua believed that Huitzilopochtli could grant them fair
weather for the fructification of their crops, and they placed an image
of Tlaloc, the rain-god, near him, so that, if necessary, the war-god
could compel the rain-maker to exert his pluvial powers or to abstain
from the creation of floods. We must, in considering the nature of this
deity, bear well in mind the connection in the Nahua consciousness
between the pantheon, war, and the food-supply. If war was not waged
annually the gods must go without flesh food and perish, and if the
gods succumbed the crops would fail, and famine would destroy the race.
So it was small wonder that Huitzilopochtli was one of the chief gods
of Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">Huitzilopochtli&rsquo;s principal festival was the
Toxcatl, celebrated immediately after the Toxcatl festival of
Tezcatlipoca, to which it bore a strong resemblance. Festivals of the
god were held in May and December, at the latter of which an image of
him, moulded in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>dough kneaded with the blood of sacrificed
children, was pierced by the presiding priest with an arrow&mdash;an
act significant of the death of Huitzilopochtli until his resurrection
in the next year.</p>
<p class="par">Strangely enough, when the absolute supremacy of
Tezcatlipoca is remembered, the high-priest of Huitzilopochtli, the
Mexicatl Teohuatzin, was considered to be the religious head of the
Mexican priesthood. The priests of Huitzilopochtli held office by right
of descent, and their primate exacted absolute obedience from the
priesthoods of all the other deities, being regarded as next to the
monarch himself in power and dominion.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tlaloc, the Rain-God</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tlaloc was the god of rain and moisture. In a
country such as Mexico, where the success or failure of the crops
depends entirely upon the plentiful nature or otherwise of the
rainfall, he was, it will be readily granted, a deity of high
importance. It was believed that he made his home in the mountains
which surround the valley of Mexico, as these were the source of the
local rainfall, and his popularity is vouched for by the fact that
sculptured representations of him occur more often than those of any
other of the Mexican deities. He is generally represented in a
semi-recumbent attitude, with the upper part of the body raised upon
the elbows, and the knees half drawn up, probably to represent the
mountainous character of the country whence comes the rain. He was
espoused to Chalchihuitlicue (Emerald Lady), who bore him a numerous
progeny, the Tlalocs (Clouds). Many of the figures which represented
him were carved from the green stone called <i>chalchiuitl</i>
(jadeite), to typify the colour of water, and in some of these he was
shown holding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>a serpent of gold to typify the lightning, for
water-gods are often closely identified with the thunder, which hangs
over the hills and accompanies heavy rains. Tlaloc, like his prototype,
the Kiche god Hurakan, manifested himself in three forms, as the
lightning-flash, the thunderbolt, and the thunder. Although his image
faced the east, where he was supposed to have originated, he was
worshipped as inhabiting the four cardinal points and every
mountain-top. The colours of the four points of the compass, yellow,
green, red, and blue, whence came the rain-bearing winds, entered into
the composition of his costume, which was further crossed with streaks
of silver, typifying the mountain torrents. A vase containing every
description of grain was usually placed before his idol, an offering of
the growth which it was hoped he would fructify. He dwelt in a
many-watered paradise called Tlalocan (The Country of Tlaloc), a place
of plenty and fruitfulness, where those who had been drowned or struck
by lightning or had died from dropsical diseases enjoyed eternal bliss.
Those of the common people who did not die such deaths went to the dark
abode of Mictlan, the all-devouring and gloomy Lord of Death.</p>

<p class="par">In the native manuscripts Tlaloc is usually portrayed as
having a dark complexion, a large round eye, a row of tusks, and over
the lips an angular blue stripe curved downward and rolled up at the
ends. The latter character is supposed to have been evolved originally
from the coils of two snakes, their mouths with long fangs in the upper
jaw meeting in the middle of the upper lip. The snake, besides being
symbolised by lightning in many American mythologies, is also
symbolical of water, which is well typified in its sinuous
movements.</p>
<p class="par">Many maidens and children were annually sacrificed to
Tlaloc. If the children wept it was regarded as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>happy
omen for a rainy season. The Etzalqualiztli (When they eat Bean Food)
was his chief festival, and was held on a day approximating to May 13,
about which date the rainy season usually commenced. Another festival
in his honour, the Quauitleua, commenced the Mexican year on February
2. At the former festival the priests of Tlaloc plunged into a lake,
imitating the sounds and movements of frogs, which, as denizens of
water, were under the special protection of the god. Chalchihuitlicue,
his wife, was often symbolised by the small image of a frog.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sacrifices to Tlaloc</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Human sacrifices also took place at certain points
in the mountains where artificial ponds were consecrated to Tlaloc.
Cemeteries were situated in their vicinity, and offerings to the god
interred near the burial-place of the bodies of the victims slain in
his service. His statue was placed on the highest mountain of Tezcuco,
and an old writer mentions that five or six young children were
annually offered to the god at various points, their hearts torn out,
and their remains interred. The mountains Popocatepetl and Teocuinani
were regarded as his special high places, and on the heights of the
latter was built his temple, in which stood his image carved in green
stone.</p>
<p class="par">The Nahua believed that the constant production of food
and rain induced a condition of senility in those deities whose duty it
was to provide them. This they attempted to stave off, fearing that if
they failed in so doing the gods would perish. They afforded them,
accordingly, a period of rest and recuperation, and once in eight years
a festival called the Atamalqualiztli (Fast of Porridge-balls and
Water) was held, during which every one in the Nahua community returned
for the time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>being to the conditions of savage life. Dressed in
costumes representing all forms of animal and bird life, and mimicking
the sounds made by the various creatures they typified, the people
danced round the <i>teocalli</i> of Tlaloc for the purpose of diverting
and entertaining him after his labours in producing the fertilising
rains of the past eight years. A lake was filled with water-snakes and
frogs, and into this the people plunged, catching the reptiles in their
mouths and devouring them alive. The only grain food which might be
partaken during this season of rest was thin water-porridge of
maize.</p>
<p class="par">Should one of the more prosperous peasants or yeomen
deem a rainfall necessary to the growth of his crops, or should he fear
a drought, he sought out one of the professional makers of dough or
paste idols, whom he desired to mould one of Tlaloc. To this image
offerings of maize-porridge and <i>pulque</i> were made. Throughout the
night the farmer and his neighbours danced, shrieking and howling round
the figure for the purpose of rousing Tlaloc from his drought-bringing
slumbers. Next day was spent in quaffing huge libations of
<i>pulque</i>, and in much-needed rest from the exertions of the
previous night.</p>
<p class="par">In Tlaloc it is easy to trace resemblances to a
mythological conception widely prevalent among the indigenous American
peoples. He is similar to such deities as the Hurakan of the Kiche of
Guatemala, the Pillan of the aborigines of Chile, and Con, the
thunder-god of the Collao of Peru. Only his thunderous powers are not
so apparent as his rain-making abilities, and in this he differs
somewhat from the gods alluded to.</p>

<h3 class="main">Quetzalcoatl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is highly probable that Quetzalcoatl was a
deity of the pre-Nahua people of Mexico. He was regarded by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>the Aztec race as a god of somewhat alien
character, and had but a limited following in Mexico, the city of
Huitzilopochtli. In Cholula, however, and others of the older towns his
worship flourished exceedingly. He was regarded as &ldquo;The Father of
the Toltecs,&rdquo; and, legend says, was the seventh and youngest son
of the Toltec Abraham, Iztacmixcohuatl. Quetzalcoatl (whose name means
&ldquo;Feathered Serpent&rdquo; or &ldquo;Feathered Staff&rdquo;)
became, at a relatively early period, ruler of Tollan, and by his
enlightened sway and his encouragement of the liberal arts did much to
further the advancement of his people. His reign had lasted for a
period sufficient to permit of his placing the cultivated arts upon a
satisfactory basis when the country was visited by the cunning
magicians Tezcatlipoca and Coyotlinaual, god of the Amantecas.
Disentangled from its terms of myth, this statement may be taken to
imply that bands of invading Nahua first began to appear within the
Toltec territories. Tezcatlipoca, descending from the sky in the shape
of a spider by way of a fine web, proffered him a draught of
<i>pulque</i>, which so intoxicated him that the curse of lust
descended upon him, and he forgot his chastity with Quetzalpetlatl. The
doom pronounced upon him was the hard one of banishment, and he was
compelled to forsake Anahuac. His exile wrought peculiar changes upon
the face of the country. He secreted his treasures of gold and silver,
burned his palaces, transformed the cacao-trees into mezquites, and
banished all the birds from the neighbourhood of Tollan. The magicians,
nonplussed at these unexpected happenings, begged him to return, but he
refused on the ground that the sun required his presence. He proceeded
to Tabasco, the fabled land of Tlapallan, and, embarking upon a raft
made of serpents, floated away to the east. A slightly different
version of this myth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>has already been given. Other accounts state
that the king cast himself upon a funeral pyre and was consumed, and
that the ashes arising from the conflagration flew upward, and were
changed into birds of brilliant plumage. His heart also soared into the
sky, and became the morning star. The Mexicans averred that
Quetzalcoatl died when the star became visible, and thus they bestowed
upon him the title &ldquo;Lord of the Dawn.&rdquo; They further said
that when he died he was invisible for four days, and that for eight
days he wandered in the underworld, after which time the morning star
appeared, when he achieved resurrection, and ascended his throne as a
god.</p>

<p class="par first">Gilbert James</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is the contention of some authorities that the myth
of Quetzalcoatl points to his status as god of the sun. That luminary,
they say, begins his diurnal journey in the east, whence Quetzalcoatl
returned as to his native home. It will be recalled that Montezuma and
his subjects imagined that Cort&eacute;s was no other than
Quetzalcoatl, returned to his dominions, as an old prophecy declared he
would do. But that he stood for the sun itself is highly improbable, as
will be shown. First of all, however, it will be well to pay some
attention to other theories concerning his origin.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps the most important of these is that which
regards Quetzalcoatl as a god of the air. He is connected, say some,
with the cardinal points, and wears the insignia of the cross, which
symbolises them. Dr. Seler says of him: &ldquo;He has a protruding,
trumpet-like mouth, for the wind-god blows.... His figure suggests
whirls and circles. Hence his temples were built in circular form....
The head of the wind-god stands for the second of the twenty day signs,
which was called Ehecatl (Wind).&rdquo; The same authority, however, in
his essay on Mexican chronology, gives to Quetzalcoatl a dual nature,
&ldquo;the dual nature which seems to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>belong to the wind-god
Quetzalcoatl, who now appears simply a wind-god, and again seems to
show the true characters of the old god of fire and
light.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd22e1980src" href="#xd22e1980"
name="xd22e1980src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Dr. Brinton perceived in Quetzalcoatl a similar dual
nature. &ldquo;He is both lord of the eastern light and of the
winds,&rdquo; he writes (<i>Myths of the New World</i>, p. 214).
&ldquo;Like all the dawn heroes, he too was represented as of white
complexion, clothed in long, white robes, and, as many of the Aztec
gods, with a full and flowing beard.... He had been overcome by
Tezcatlipoca, the wind or spirit of night, who had descended from
heaven by a spider&rsquo;s web, and presented his rival with a draught
supposed to confer immortality, but in fact producing an intolerable
longing for home. For the wind and the light both depart when the
gloaming draws near, or when the clouds spread their dark and shadowy
webs along the mountains, and pour the vivifying rain upon the
fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The theory which derives Quetzalcoatl from a
&ldquo;culture-hero&rdquo; who once actually existed is scarcely
reconcilable with probability. It is more than likely that, as in the
case of other mythical paladins, the legend of a mighty hero arose from
the somewhat weakened idea of a great deity. Some of the early Spanish
missionaries professed to see in Quetzalcoatl the Apostle St. Thomas,
who had journeyed to America to effect its conversion!</p>

<h3 class="main">The Man of the Sun</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A more probable explanation of the origin of
Quetzalcoatl and a more likely elucidation of his nature is that which
would regard him as the Man of the Sun, who has quitted his abode for a
season for the purpose of inculcating in mankind those arts which
represent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>the first steps in civilisation, who fulfils his
mission, and who, at a late period, is displaced by the deities of an
invading race. Quetzalcoatl was represented as a traveller with staff
in hand, and this is proof of his solar character, as is the statement
that under his rule the fruits of the earth flourished more abundantly
than at any subsequent period. The abundance of gold said to have been
accumulated in his reign assists the theory, the precious metal being
invariably associated with the sun by most barbarous peoples. In the
native <i>pinturas</i> it is noticeable that the solar disc and
semi-disc are almost invariably found in connection with the feathered
serpent as the symbolical attributes of Quetzalcoatl. The Hopi Indians
of Mexico at the present day symbolise the sun as a serpent, tail in
mouth, and the ancient Mexicans introduced the solar disc in connection
with small images of Quetzalcoatl, which they attached to the
head-dress. In still other examples Quetzalcoatl is pictured as if
emerging or stepping from the luminary, which is represented as his
dwelling-place.</p>
<p class="par">Several tribes tributary to the Aztecs were in the habit
of imploring Quetzalcoatl in prayer to return and free them from the
intolerable bondage of the conqueror. Notable among them were the
Totonacs, who passionately believed that the sun, their father, would
send a god who would free them from the Aztec yoke. On the coming of
the Spaniards the European conquerors were hailed as the servants of
Quetzalcoatl, thus in the eyes of the natives fulfilling the tradition
that he would return.</p>

<h3 class="main">Various Forms of Quetzalcoatl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Various conceptions of Quetzalcoatl are noticeable
in the mythology of the territories which extended from the north of
Mexico to the marshes of Nicaragua. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>Guatemala the Kiches
recognised him as Gucumatz, and in Yucatan proper he was worshipped as
Kukulcan, both of which names are but literal translations of his
Mexican title of &ldquo;Feathered Serpent&rdquo; into Kiche and Mayan.
That the three deities are one and the same there can be no shadow of
doubt. Several authorities have seen in Kukulcan a
&ldquo;serpent-and-rain god.&rdquo; He can only be such in so far as he
is a solar god also. The cult of the feathered snake in Yucatan was
unquestionably a branch of sun-worship. In tropical latitudes the sun
draws the clouds round him at noon. The rain falls from the clouds
accompanied by thunder and lightning&mdash;the symbols of the divine
serpent. Therefore the manifestations of the heavenly serpent were
directly associated with the sun, and no statement that Kukulcan is a
mere serpent-and-water god satisfactorily elucidates his
characteristics.</p>

<h3 class="main">Quetzalcoatl&rsquo;s Northern Origin</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is by no means improbable that Quetzalcoatl was
of northern origin, and that on his adoption by southern peoples and
tribes dwelling in tropical countries his characteristics were
gradually and unconsciously altered in order to meet the exigencies of
his environment. The mythology of the Indians of British Columbia,
whence in all likelihood the Nahua originally came, is possessed of a
central figure bearing a strong resemblance to Quetzalcoatl. Thus the
Thlingit tribe worship Yetl; the Quaquiutl Indians, Kanikilak; the
Salish people of the coast, Kumsn&ouml;otl, Qu&auml;aqua, or
Sl&auml;alekam. It is noticeable that these divine beings are
worshipped as the Man of the Sun, and totally apart from the luminary
himself, as was Quetzalcoatl in Mexico. The Quaquiutl believe that
before his settlement among them for the purpose of inculcating in the
tribe the arts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>of life, the sun descended as a bird, and assumed
a human shape. Kanikilak is his son, who, as his emissary, spreads the
arts of civilisation over the world. So the Mexicans believed that
Quetzalcoatl descended first of all in the form of a bird, and was
ensnared in the fowler&rsquo;s net of the Toltec hero Hueymatzin.</p>

<p class="par">The titles bestowed upon Quetzalcoatl by the Nahua show
that in his solar significance he was god of the vault of the heavens,
as well as merely son of the sun. He was alluded to as Ehecatl (The
Air), Yolcuat (The Rattlesnake), Tohil (The Rumbler), Nanihehecatl
(Lord of the Four Winds), Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Light of the
Dawn). The whole heavenly vault was his, together with all its
phenomena. This would seem to be in direct opposition to the theory
that Tezcatlipoca was the supreme god of the Mexicans. But it must be
borne in mind that Tezcatlipoca was the god of a later age, and of a
fresh body of Nahua immigrants, and as such inimical to Quetzalcoatl,
who was probably in a similar state of opposition to Itzamna, a Maya
deity of Yucatan.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Worship of Quetzalcoatl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The worship of Quetzalcoatl was in some degree
antipathetic to that of the other Mexican deities, and his priests were
a separate caste. Although human sacrifice was by no means so prevalent
among his devotees, it is a mistake to aver, as some authorities have
done, that it did not exist in connection with his worship. A more
acceptable sacrifice to Quetzalcoatl appears to have been the blood of
the celebrant or worshipper, shed by himself. When we come to consider
the mythology of the Zapotecs, a people whose customs and beliefs
appear to have formed a species of link between the Mexican and Mayan
civilisations, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>shall find that their high-priests
occasionally enacted the legend of Quetzalcoatl in their own persons,
and that their worship, which appears to have been based upon that of
Quetzalcoatl, had as one of its most pronounced characteristics the
shedding of blood. The celebrant or devotee drew blood from the vessels
lying under the tongue or behind the ear by drawing across those tender
parts a cord made from the thorn-covered fibres of the agave. The blood
was smeared over the mouths of the idols. In this practice we can
perceive an act analogous to the sacrificial substitution of the part
for the whole, as obtaining in early Palestine and many other
countries&mdash;a certain sign that tribal or racial opinion has
contracted a disgust for human sacrifice, and has sought to evade the
anger of the gods by yielding to them a portion of the blood of each
worshipper, instead of sacrificing the life of one for the general
weal.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Maize-Gods of Mexico</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A special group of deities called Centeotl
presided over the agriculture of Mexico, each of whom personified one
or other of the various aspects of the maize-plant. The chief goddess
of maize, however, was Chicomecohuatl (Seven-serpent), her name being
an allusion to the fertilising power of water, which element the
Mexicans symbolised by the serpent. As Xilonen she typified the
<i>xilote</i>, or green ear of the maize. But it is probable that
Chicomecohuatl was the creation of an older race, and that the Nahua
new-comers adopted or brought with them another growth-spirit, the
&ldquo;Earth-mother,&rdquo; Teteoinnan (Mother of the Gods), or
Tocitzin (Our Grandmother). This goddess had a son, Centeotl, a male
maize-spirit. Sometimes the mother was also known as Centeotl, the
generic name for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>entire group, and this fact has led to some
confusion in the minds of Americanists. But this does not mean that
Chicomecohuatl was by any means neglected. Her spring festival, held on
April 5, was known as Hueytozoztli (The Great Watch), and was
accompanied by a general fast, when the dwellings of the Mexicans were
decorated with bulrushes which had been sprinkled with blood drawn from
the extremities of the inmates. The statues of the little
<i>tepitoton</i> (household gods) were also decorated. The worshippers
then proceeded to the maize-fields, where they pulled the tender stalks
of the growing maize, and, having decorated them with flowers, placed
them in the <i>calpulli</i> (the common house of the village). A mock
combat then took place before the altar of Chicomecohuatl. The girls of
the village presented the goddess with bundles of maize of the previous
season&rsquo;s harvesting, later restoring them to the granaries in
order that they might be utilised for seed for the coming year.
Chicomecohuatl was always represented among the household deities of
the Mexicans, and on the occasion of her festival the family placed
before the image a basket of provisions surmounted by a cooked frog,
bearing on its back a piece of cornstalk stuffed with pounded maize and
vegetables. This frog was symbolic of Chalchihuitlicue, wife of Tlaloc,
the rain-god, who assisted Chicomecohuatl in providing a bountiful
harvest. In order that the soil might further benefit, a frog, the
symbol of water, was sacrificed, so that its vitality should recuperate
that of the weary and much-burdened earth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A more important festival of Chicomecohuatl,
however, was the Xalaquia, which lasted from June 28 to July 14,
commencing when the maize plant had attained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>its full
growth. The women of the <i>pueblo</i> (village) wore their hair
unbound, and shook and tossed it so that by sympathetic magic the maize
might take the hint and grow correspondingly long. <i>Chian pinolli</i>
was consumed in immense quantities, and maize-porridge was eaten.
Hilarious dances were nightly performed in the <i>teopan</i> (temple),
the central figure in which was the Xalaquia, a female captive or
slave, with face painted red and yellow to represent the colours of the
maize-plant. She had previously undergone a long course of training in
the dancing-school, and now, all unaware of the horrible fate awaiting
her, she danced and pirouetted gaily among the rest. Throughout the
duration of the festival she danced, and on its expiring night she was
accompanied in the dance by the women of the community, who circled
round her, chanting the deeds of Chicomecohuatl. When daybreak appeared
the company was joined by the chiefs and headmen, who, along with the
exhausted and half-fainting victim, danced the solemn death-dance. The
entire community then approached the <i>teocalli</i> (pyramid of
sacrifice), and, its summit reached, the victim was stripped to a nude
condition, the priest plunged a knife of flint into her bosom, and,
tearing out the still palpitating heart, offered it up to
Chicomecohuatl. In this manner the venerable goddess, weary with the
labours of inducing growth in the maize-plant, was supposed to be
revivified and refreshed. Hence the name Xalaquia, which signifies
&ldquo;She who is clothed with the Sand.&rdquo; Until the death of the
victim it was not lawful to partake of the new corn.</p>

<p class="par first">&ldquo;All the great idols of Mexico were thought
to have been destroyed until this was disinterred among other relics in
the course of making new drains in the Plaza Mayor of Mexico in August
1790. The discovery produced an immense sensation. The idol was dragged
to the court of the University, and there set up; the Indians began to
worship it and deck it with flowers; the antiquaries, with about the
same degree of intelligence, to speculate about it. What most puzzled
them was that the face and some other parts of the goddess are found in
duplicate at the back of the figure; hence they concluded it to
represent two gods in one, the principal of whom they further concluded
to be a female, the other, indicated by the back, a male. The standard
author on Mexican antiquities at that time was the Italian
<i>dilettante</i> Boturini, of whom it may be said that he is better,
but not much better, than nothing at all. From page 27 of his work the
antiquaries learned that Huitzilopochtli was accompanied by the goddess
Teoyaominqui, who was charged with collecting the souls of those slain
in war and sacrifice. This was enough. The figure was at once named
Teoyaominqui or Huitzilopochtli (The One plus the Other), and has been
so called ever since. The antiquaries next elevated this imaginary
goddess to the rank of the war-god&rsquo;s wife. &lsquo;A
soldier,&rsquo; says <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>Bardolph, &lsquo;is better accommodated than
with a wife&rsquo;: <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>, so is a war-god.
Besides, as Torquemada (vol. ii. p. 47) says with perfect truth, the
Mexicans did not think so grossly of the divinity as to have married
gods or goddesses at all. The figure is undoubtedly a female. It has no
vestige of any weapon about it, nor has it any limbs. It differs in
every particular from the war-god Huitzilopochtli, every detail of
which is perfectly well known. There never was any goddess called
Teoyaominqui. This may be plausibly inferred from the fact that such a
goddess is unknown not merely to Sahagun, Torquemada, Acosta,
Tezozomoc, Duran, and Clavigero, but to all other writers except
Boturini. The blunder of the last-named writer is easily explained.
Antonio Leon y Gama, a Mexican astronomer, wrote an account of the
discoveries of 1790, in which, evidently puzzled by the name of
Teoyaominqui, he quotes a manuscript in Mexican, said to have been
written by an Indian of Tezcuco, who was born in 1528, to the effect
that Teoyaotlatohua and Teoyaominqui were spirits who presided over the
fifteenth of the twenty signs of the fortune-tellers&rsquo; calendar,
and that those born in this sign would be brave warriors, but would
soon die. (As the fifteenth sign was <i>quauhtli</i>, this is likely
enough.) When their hour had come the former spirit scented them out,
the latter killed them. The rubbish printed about Huitzilopochtli,
Teoyaominqui, and Mictlantecutli in connection with this statue would
fill a respectable volume. The reason why the features were duplicated
is obvious. The figure was carried in the midst of a large crowd.
Probably it was considered to be an evil omen if the idol turned away
its face from its worshippers; this the duplicate obviated. So when the
dance was performed round the figure (<i>cf.</i> Janus). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>This
duplication of the features, a characteristic of the very oldest gods,
appears to be indicated when the numeral <i>ome</i> (two) is prefixed
to the title of the deity. Thus the two ancestors and preservers of the
race were called Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl (two-chief, two-woman),
ancient Toltec gods, who at the conquest become less prominent in the
theology of Mexico, and who are best represented in that of the Mexican
colony of Nicaragua.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">During her last hours the victim sacrificed at the
Xalaquia wore a ritual dress made from the fibres of the aloe, and with
this garment the maize-god Centeotl was clothed. Robed in this he
temporarily represented the earth-goddess, so that he might receive her
sacrifice. The blood of victims was offered up to him in a vessel
decorated with that brilliant and artistic feather-work which excited
such admiration in the breasts of the connoisseurs and &aelig;sthetes
of the Europe of the sixteenth century. Upon partaking of this
blood-offering the deity emitted a groan so intense and terrifying that
it has been left on record that such Spaniards as were present became
panic-stricken. This ceremony was followed by another, the
<i>niti&ccedil;apoloa</i> (tasting of the soil), which consisted in
raising a little earth on one finger to the mouth and eating it.</p>
<p class="par">As has been said, Centeotl the son has been confounded
with Centeotl the mother, who is in reality the earth-mother
Teteoinnan. Each of these deities had a <i>teopan</i> (temple) of his
or her own, but they were closely allied as parent and child. But of
the two, Centeotl the son was the more important. On the death of the
sacrificed victim her skin was conveyed to the temple of Centeotl the
son, and worn there in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>succeeding ritual by the officiating
priests. This gruesome dress is frequently depicted in the Aztec
<i>pinturas</i>, where the skin of the hands, and in some instances the
feet, of the victims can be seen dangling from the wrists and ankles of
the priest.</p>

<h3 class="main">Importance of the Food-Gods</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">To the Mexicans the deities of most importance to
the community as a whole were undoubtedly the food-gods. In their
emergence from the hunting to the agricultural state of life, when they
began to exist almost solely upon the fruits of the earth, the Mexicans
were quick to recognise that the old deities of the chase, such as
Mixcoatl, could not now avail them or succour them in the same manner
as the guardians of the crops and fertilisers of the soil. Gradually we
see these gods, then, advance in power and influence until at the time
of the Spanish invasion we find them paramount. Even the terrible
war-god himself had an agricultural significance, as we have pointed
out. A distinct bargain with the food-gods can be clearly traced, and
is none the less obvious because it was never written or codified. The
covenant was as binding to the native mind as any made betwixt god and
man in ancient Palestine, and included mutual assistance as well as
provision for mere alimentary supply. In no mythology is the
understanding between god and man so clearly defined as in the Nahuan,
and in none is its operation better exemplified.</p>

<h3 class="main">Xipe</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Xipe (The Flayed) was widely worshipped throughout
Mexico, and is usually depicted in the <i>pinturas</i> as being attired
in a flayed human skin. At his special <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>festival, the
&ldquo;Man-flaying,&rdquo; the skins were removed from the victims and
worn by the devotees of the god for the succeeding twenty days. He is
usually represented as of a red colour. In the later days of the Aztec
monarchy the kings and leaders of Mexico assumed the dress or classical
garments of Xipe. This dress consisted of a crown made of feathers of
the roseate spoonbill, the gilt timbrel, the jacket of spoonbill
feathers, and an apron of green feathers lapping over one another in a
tile-like pattern. In the Cozcatzin Codex we see a picture of King
Axayacatl dressed as Xipe in a feather skirt, and having a tiger-skin
scabbard to his sword. The hands of a flayed human skin also dangle
over the monarch&rsquo;s wrists, and the feet fall over his feet like
gaiters.</p>
<p class="par">Xipe&rsquo;s shield is a round target covered with the
rose-coloured feathers of the spoonbill, with concentric circles of a
darker hue on the surface. There are examples of it divided into an
upper and lower part, the former showing an emerald on a blue field,
and the latter a tiger-skin design. Xipe was imagined as possessing
three forms, the first that of the roseate spoonbill, the second that
of the blue cotinga, and the last that of a tiger, the three shapes
perhaps corresponding to the regions of heaven, earth, and hell, or to
the three elements, fire, earth, and water. The deities of many North
American Indian tribes show similar variations in form and colour,
which are supposed to follow as the divinity changes his dwelling to
north, south, east, or west. But Xipe is seldom depicted in the
<i>pinturas</i> in any other form but that of the red god, the form in
which the Mexicans adopted him from the Yopi tribe of the Pacific
slope. He is the god of human sacrifice <i>par excellence</i>, and may
be regarded as a Yopi equivalent of Tezcatlipoca. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Nanahuatl (Poor Leper) presided over skin
diseases, such as leprosy. It was thought that persons afflicted with
these complaints were set apart by the moon for his service. In the
Nahua tongue the words for &ldquo;leprous&rdquo; and
&ldquo;eczematous&rdquo; also mean &ldquo;divine.&rdquo; The myth of
Nanahuatl tells how before the sun was created humanity dwelt in sable
and horrid gloom. Only a human sacrifice could hasten the appearance of
the luminary. Metztli (The Moon) led forth Nanahuatl as a sacrifice,
and he was cast upon a funeral pyre, in the flames of which he was
consumed. Metztli also cast herself upon the mass of flame, and with
her death the sun rose above the horizon. There can be no doubt that
the myth refers to the consuming of the starry or spotted night, and
incidentally to the nightly death of the moon at the flaming hour of
dawn.</p>

<h3 class="main">Xolotl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Xolotl is of southern, possibly Zapotec, origin.
He represents either fire rushing down from the heavens or light
flaming upward. It is noticeable that in the <i>pinturas</i> the
picture of the setting sun being devoured by the earth is nearly always
placed opposite his image. He is probably identical with Nanahuatl, and
appears as the representative of human sacrifice. He has also
affinities with Xipe. On the whole Xolotl may be best described as a
sun-god of the more southerly tribes. His head (<i>quaxolotl</i>) was
one of the most famous devices for warriors&rsquo; use, as sacrifice
among the Nahua was, as we have seen, closely associated with
warfare.</p>
<p class="par">Xolotl was a mythical figure quite foreign to the
peoples of Anahuac or Mexico, who regarded him as something strange and
monstrous. He is alluded to as the &ldquo;God of Monstrosities,&rdquo;
and, thinks Dr. Seler, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>word &ldquo;monstrosity&rdquo; may
suitably translate his name. He is depicted with empty eye-sockets,
which circumstance is explained by the myth that when the gods
determined to sacrifice themselves in order to give life and strength
to the newly created sun, Xolotl withdrew, and wept so much that his
eyes fell out of their sockets. This was the Mexican explanation of a
Zapotec attribute. Xolotl was originally the &ldquo;Lightning
Beast&rdquo; of the Maya or some other southern folk, and was
represented by them as a dog, since that animal appeared to them to be
the creature which he most resembled. But he was by no means a
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; dog, hence their conception of him as unnatural.
Dr. Seler is inclined to identify him with the tapir, and indeed
Sahagun speaks of a strange animal-being, <i>tlaca-xolotl</i>, which
has &ldquo;a large snout, large teeth, hoofs like an ox, a thick hide,
and reddish hair&rdquo;&mdash;not a bad description of the tapir of
Central America. Of course to the Mexicans the god Xolotl was no longer
an animal, although he had evolved from one, and was imagined by them
to have the form shown in the accompanying illustration.</p>

<p class="par first">This deity was known in Mexico under various
names, notably Tata (Our Father), Huehueteotl (Oldest of Gods), and
Xiuhtecutli (Lord of the Year). He was represented as of the colour of
fire, with a black face, a headdress of green feathers, and bearing on
his back a yellow serpent, to typify the serpentine nature of fire. He
also bore a mirror of gold to show his connection with the sun, from
which all heat emanates. On rising in the morning all Mexican families
made Xiuhtecutli an offering of a piece of bread and a drink. He was
thus not only, like Vulcan, the god of thunderbolts and conflagrations,
but also the milder deity of the domestic hearth. Once a year the fire
in every Mexican house was extinguished, and rekindled by friction
before the idol of Xiuhtecutli. When a Mexican baby was born it passed
through a baptism of fire on the fourth day, up to which time a fire,
lighted at the time of its birth, was kept burning in order to nourish
its existence.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mictlan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mictlantecutli (Lord of Hades) was God of the Dead
and of the grim and shadowy realm to which the souls of men repair
after their mortal sojourn. He is represented in the <i>pinturas</i> as
a grisly monster with capacious mouth, into which fall the spirits of
the dead. His terrible abode was sometimes alluded to as Tlalxicco
(Navel of the Earth), but the Mexicans in general seem to have thought
that it was situated in the far north, which they regarded as a place
of famine, desolation, and death. Here those who by the circumstances
of their demise were unfitted to enter the paradise of
Tlaloc&mdash;namely, those who had not been drowned or had not died a
warrior&rsquo;s death, or, in the case of women, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>had not
died in childbed&mdash;passed a dreary and meaningless existence.
Mictlan was surrounded by a species of demons called
<i>tzitzimimes</i>, and had a spouse, Mictecaciuatl. When we come to
discuss the analogous deity of the Maya we shall see that in all
probability Mictlan was represented by the bat, the animal typical of
the underworld. In a preceding paragraph dealing with the funerary
customs we have described the journey of the soul to the abode of
Mictlan, and the ordeals through which the spirit of the defunct had to
pass ere entering his realm (see p. 37).</p>

<h3 class="main">Worship of the Planet Venus</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Mexicans designated the planet Venus Citlalpol
(The Great Star) and Tlauizcalpantecutli (Lord of the Dawn). It seems
to have been the only star worshipped by them, and was regarded with
considerable veneration. Upon its rising they stopped up the chimneys
of their houses, so that no harm of any kind might enter with its
light. A column called Ilhuicatlan, meaning &ldquo;In the Sky,&rdquo;
stood in the court of the great temple of Mexico, and upon this a
symbol of the planet was painted. On its reappearance during its usual
circuit, captives were taken before this representation and sacrificed
to it. It will be remembered that the myth of Quetzalcoatl states that
the heart of that deity flew upward from the funeral pyre on which he
was consumed and became the planet Venus. It is not easy to say whether
or not this myth is anterior to the adoption of the worship of the
planet by the Nahua, for it may be a tale of pre- or post-Nahuan
growth. In the <i>tonalamatl</i> Tlauizcalpantecutli is represented as
lord of the ninth division of thirteen days, beginning with Ce Coatl
(the sign of &ldquo;One Serpent&rdquo;). In several of the
<i>pinturas</i> he is represented as having a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>white
body with long red stripes, while round his eyes is a deep black
painting like a domino mask, bordered with small white circles. His
lips are a bright vermilion. The red stripes are probably introduced to
accentuate the whiteness of his body, which is understood to symbolise
the peculiar half-light which emanates from the planet. The black paint
on the face, surrounding the eye, typifies the dark sky of night. In
Mexican and Central American symbolism the eye often represents light,
and here, surrounded by blackness as it is, it is perhaps almost
hieroglyphic. As the star of evening, Tlauizcalpantecutli is sometimes
shown with the face of a skull, to signify his descent into the
underworld, whither he follows the sun. That the Mexicans and Maya
carefully and accurately observed his periods of revolution is
witnessed by the <i>pinturas</i>.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sun-Worship</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The sun was regarded by the Nahua, and indeed by
all the Mexican and Central American peoples, as the supreme deity, or
rather the principal source of subsistence and life. He was always
alluded to as <i>the teotl</i>, <i>the</i> god, and his worship formed
as it were a background to that of all the other gods. His Mexican
name, Ipalnemohuani (He by whom Men Live) shows that the Mexicans
regarded him as the primal source of being, and the heart, the symbol
of life, was looked upon as his special sacrifice. Those who rose at
sunrise to prepare food for the day held up to him on his appearance
the hearts of animals they had slain for cooking, and even the hearts
of the victims to Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli were first held up
to the sun, as if he had a primary right to the sacrifice, before being
cast into the bowl of copal which lay at the feet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>of the
idol. It was supposed that the luminary rejoiced in offerings of blood,
and that it constituted the only food which would render him
sufficiently vigorous to undertake his daily journey through the
heavens. He is often depicted in the <i>pinturas</i> as licking up the
gore of the sacrificial victims with his long tongue-like rays. The sun
must fare well if he was to continue to give life, light, and heat to
mankind.</p>

<p class="par">The Mexicans, as we have already seen, believed that the
luminary they knew had been preceded by others, each of which had been
quenched by some awful cataclysm of nature. Eternity had, in fact, been
broken up into epochs, marked by the destruction of successive suns. In
the period preceding that in which they lived, a mighty deluge had
deprived the sun of life, and some such catastrophe was apprehended at
the end of every &ldquo;sheaf&rdquo; of fifty-two years. The old suns
were dead, and the current sun was no more immortal than they. At the
end of one of the &ldquo;sheaves&rdquo; he too would succumb.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sustaining the Sun</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was therefore necessary to sustain the sun by
the daily food of human sacrifice, for by a tithe of human life alone
would he be satisfied. Naturally a people holding such a belief would
look elsewhere than within their own borders for the material wherewith
to placate their deity. This could be most suitably found among the
inhabitants of a neighbouring state. It thus became the business of the
warrior class in the Aztec state to furnish forth the altars of the
gods with human victims. The most suitable district of supply was the
<i>pueblo</i> of Tlaxcallan, or Tlascala, the people of which were of
cognate origin to the Aztecs. The communities had, although related,
been separated for so many generations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>that they had begun to
regard each other as traditional enemies, and on a given day in the
year their forces met at an appointed spot for the purpose of engaging
in a strife which should furnish one side or the other with a
sufficiency of victims for the purpose of sacrifice. The warrior who
captured the largest number of opponents alive was regarded as the
champion of the day, and was awarded the chief honours of the combat.
The sun was therefore the god of warriors, as he would give them
victory in battle in order that they might supply him with food. The
rites of this military worship of the luminary were held in the
Quauhquauhtinchan (House of the Eagles), an armoury set apart for the
regiment of that name. On March 17 and December 1 and 2, at the
ceremonies known as Nauhollin (The Four Motions&mdash;alluding to the
quivering appearance of the sun&rsquo;s rays), the warriors gathered in
this hall for the purpose of despatching a messenger to their lord the
sun. High up on the wall of the principal court was a great symbolic
representation of the orb, painted upon a brightly coloured cotton
hanging. Before this copal and other fragrant gums and spices were
burned four times a day. The victim, a war-captive, was placed at the
foot of a long staircase leading up to the Quauhxicalli (Cup of the
Eagles), the name of the stone on which he was to be sacrificed. He was
clothed in red striped with white and wore white plumes in his
hair&mdash;colours symbolical of the sun&mdash;while he bore a staff
decorated with feathers and a shield covered with tufts of cotton. He
also carried a bundle of eagle&rsquo;s feathers and some paint on his
shoulders, to enable the sun, to whom he was the emissary, to paint his
face. He was then addressed by the officiating priest in the following
terms: &ldquo;Sir, we pray you go to our god the sun, and greet him on
our behalf; tell him that his sons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>and warriors and chiefs and
those who remain here beg of him to remember them and to favour them
from that place where he is, and to receive this small offering which
we send him. Give him this staff to help him on his journey, and this
shield for his defence, and all the rest that you have in this
bundle.&rdquo; The victim, having undertaken to carry the message to
the sun-god, was then despatched upon his long journey.</p>
<p class="par">A Quauhxicalli is preserved in the National Museum of
Mexico. It consists of a basaltic mass, circular in form, on which are
shown in sculpture a series of groups representing Mexican warriors
receiving the submission of war-captives. The prisoner tenders a flower
to his captor, symbolical of the life he is about to offer up, for
lives were the &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; offered to the gods, and the
campaign in which these &ldquo;blossoms&rdquo; were captured was called
Xochiyayotl (The War of Flowers). The warriors who receive the
submission of the captives are represented in the act of tearing the
plumes from their heads. These bas-reliefs occupy the sides of the
stone. The face of it is covered by a great solar disc having eight
rays, and the surface is hollowed out in the middle to form a
receptacle for blood&mdash;the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; alluded to in the name
of the stone. The Quauhxicalli must not be confounded with the
<i>temalacatl</i> (spindle stone), to which the alien warrior who
received a chance of life was secured. The gladiatorial combat gave the
war-captive an opportunity to escape through superior address in arms.
The <i>temalacatl</i> was somewhat higher than a man, and was provided
with a platform at the top, in the middle of which was placed a great
stone with a hole in it through which a rope was passed. To this the
war-captive was secured, and if he could vanquish seven of his captors
he was released. If he failed to do so he was at once sacrificed.

battle. This explains the desperate nature of their resistance to the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The chief of the festivals to the sun was that
held in spring at the vernal equinox, before the representation of a
deity known as Totec (Our Great Chief). Although Totec was a solar
deity he had been adopted from the people of an alien state, the
Zapotecs of Zalisco, and is therefore scarcely to be regarded as the
principal sun-god. His festival was celebrated by the symbolical
slaughter of all the other gods for the purpose of providing sustenance
to the sun, each of the gods being figuratively slain in the person of
a victim. Totec was attired in the same manner as the warrior
despatched twice a year to assure the sun of the loyalty of the
Mexicans. The festival appears to have been primarily a seasonal one,
as bunches of dried maize were offered to Totec. But its larger meaning
is obvious. It was, indeed, a commemoration of the creation of the sun.
This is proved by the description of the image of Totec, which was
robed and equipped as the solar traveller, by the solar disc and tables
of the sun&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"
name="pb102">102</a>]</span>progress carved on the altar employed in
the ceremony, and by the robes of the victims, who were dressed to
represent dwellers in the sun-god&rsquo;s halls. Perhaps Totec,
although of alien origin, was the only deity possessed by the Mexicans
who directly represented the sun. As a borrowed god he would have but a
minor position in the Mexican pantheon, but again as the only sun-god
whom it was necessary to bring into prominence during a strictly solar
festival he would be for the time, of course, a very important deity
indeed.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tepeyollotl means Heart of the Mountain, and
evidently alludes to a deity whom the Nahua connected with seismic
disturbances and earthquakes. By the interpreter of the Codex
Telleriano-Remensis he is called Tepeolotlec, an obvious distortion of
his real name. The interpreter of the codex states that his name
&ldquo;refers to the condition of the earth after the flood. The
sacrifices of these thirteen days were not good, and the literal
translation of their name is &lsquo;dirt sacrifices.&rsquo; They caused
palsy and bad humours.... This Tepeolotlec was lord of these thirteen
days. In them were celebrated the feast to the jaguar, and the last
four preceding days were days of fasting.... Tepeolotlec means the
&lsquo;Lord of Beasts.&rsquo; The four feast days were in honour of the
Suchiquezal, who was the man that remained behind on the earth upon
which we now live. This Tepeolotlec was the same as the echo of the
voice when it re-echoes in a valley from one mountain to another. This
name &lsquo;jaguar&rsquo; is given to the earth because the jaguar is
the boldest animal, and the echo which the voice awakens in the
mountains is a survival of the flood, it is said.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">From this we can see that Tepeyollotl is a deity of the
earth pure and simple, a god of desert places. It is certain that he
was not a Mexican god, or at least was not of Nahua origin, as he is
mentioned by none of those writers who deal with Nahua traditions, and
we must look for him among the Mixtecs and Zapotecs.</p>

be equally true. The Zapotecs represented him with a design resembling
a butterfly about the mouth, and a many-coloured face which looks out
of the open jaws of a bird with a tall and erect crest. The worship of
this god appears to have been very widespread. Sahagun says of him that
a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> was held in his honour, which was preceded by a
rigorous fast. The people covered themselves with ornaments and jewels
symbolic of the deity, as if they desired to represent him, and dancing
and singing proceeded gaily to the sound of the drum. Offerings of the
blood of various animals followed, and specially prepared cakes were
submitted to the god. This simple fare, however, was later followed by
human sacrifices, rendered by the notables, who brought certain of
their slaves for immolation. This completed the festival.</p>

the creative deity, or perhaps more correctly of deity in general. They
occupied the first place in the Nahua calendar, to signify that they
had existed from the beginning, and they are usually represented as
being clothed in rich attire. Ometecutli (a literal translation of his
name is Two-Lord) is sometimes identified with the sky and the
fire-god, the female deity representing the earth or

<h3 class="main">The Pulque-Gods</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When a man was intoxicated with the native Mexican
drink of <i>pulque</i>, a liquor made from the juice of the <i>Agave
Americana</i>, he was believed to be under the influence of a god or
spirit. The commonest form under which the drink-god was worshipped was
the rabbit, that animal being considered to be utterly devoid of sense.
This particular divinity was known as Ometochtli. The scale of
debauchery which it was desired to reach was indicated by the number of
rabbits worshipped, the highest number, four hundred, representing the
most extreme degree of intoxication. The chief <i>pulque</i>-gods apart
from these were Patecatl and Tequechmecauiani. If the drunkard desired
to escape the perils of accidental hanging during intoxication, it was
necessary to sacrifice to the latter, but if death by drowning was
apprehended Teatlahuiani, the deity who harried drunkards to a watery
grave, was placated. If the debauchee wished his punishment not to
exceed a headache, Quatlapanqui (The Head-splitter) was sacrificed to,
or else Papaztac (The Nerveless). Each <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>trade or profession
had its own Ometochtli, but for the aristocracy there was only one of
these gods, Cohuatzincatl, a name signifying &ldquo;He who has
Grandparents.&rdquo; Several of these drink-gods had names which
connected them with various localities; for example, Tepoxtecatl was
the <i>pulque</i>-god of Tepoztlan. The calendar day Ometochtli, which
means &ldquo;Two-Rabbit,&rdquo; because of the symbol which accompanied
it, was under the special protection of these gods, and the Mexicans
believed that any one born on that day was almost inevitably doomed to
become a drunkard. All the <i>pulque</i>-gods were closely associated
with the soil, and with the earth-goddess. They wore the golden Huaxtec
nose-ornament, the <i>yaca-metztli</i>, of crescent shape, which
characterised the latter, and indeed this ornament was inscribed upon
all articles sacred to the <i>pulque</i>-gods. Their faces were painted
red and black, as were objects consecrated to them, their blankets and
shields. After the Indians had harvested their maize they drank to
intoxication, and invoked one or other of these gods. On the whole it
is safe to infer that they were originally deities of local husbandry
who imparted virtue to the soil as <i>pulque</i> imparted strength and
courage to the warrior. The accompanying sketch of the god Tepoxtecatl
(see p. 117) well illustrates the distinguishing characteristics of the
<i>pulque</i>-god class. Here we can observe the face painted in two
colours, the crescent-shaped nose-ornament, the bicoloured shield, the
long necklace made from the <i>malinalli</i> herb, and the
ear-pendants.</p>
<p class="par">It is of course clear that the drink-gods were of the
same class as the food-gods&mdash;patrons of the fruitful
soil&mdash;but it is strange that they should be male whilst the
food-gods are mostly female. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=

the Mexican goddess of the moon. She had in reality two phases, one
that of a beneficent protectress of harvests and promoter of growth in

airs, ghosts, mysterious shapes of the dim half-light of night and its
oppressive silence.</p>
<p class="par">To a people in the agricultural stage of civilisation
the moon appears as the great recorder of harvests. But she has also
supremacy over water, which is always connected by primitive peoples
with the moon. Citatli (Moon) and Atl (Water) are constantly confounded
in Nahua myth, and in many ways their characteristics were blended. It
was Metztli who led forth Nanahuatl the Leprous to the pyre whereon he
perished&mdash;a reference to the dawn, in which the starry sky of
night is consumed in the fires of the rising sun.</p>

<h3 class="main">Tlazolteotl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tlazolteotl (God of Ordure), or Tlaelquani
(Filth-eater), was called by the Mexicans the earth-goddess because she
was the eradicator of sins, to whose priests the people went to make
confession so that they might be absolved from their misdeeds. Sin was
symbolised by the Mexicans as excrement. Confession covered only the
sins of immorality. But if Tlazolteotl was the goddess of confession,
she was also the patroness of desire and luxury. It was, however, as a
deity whose chief office was the eradication of human sin that she was
pre-eminent. The process by which this was supposed to be effected is
quaintly described by Sahagun in the twelfth chapter of his first book.
The penitent addressed the confessor as follows: &ldquo;Sir, I desire
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>approach that most powerful god, the protector
of all, that is to say, Tezcatlipoca. I desire to tell him my sins in
secret.&rdquo; The confessor replied: &ldquo;Be happy, my son: that
which thou wishest to do will be to thy good and advantage.&rdquo; The
confessor then opened the divinatory book known as the Tonalamatl (that
is, the Book of the Calendar) and acquainted the applicant with the day
which appeared the most suitable for his confession. The day having
arrived, the penitent provided himself with a mat, copal gum to burn as
incense, and wood whereon to burn it. If he was a person high in office
the priest repaired to his house, but in the case of lesser people the
confession took place in the dwelling of the priest. Having lighted the
fire and burned the incense, the penitent addressed the fire in the
following terms: &ldquo;Thou, lord, who art the father and mother of
the gods, and the most ancient of them all, thy servant, thy slave bows
before thee. Weeping, he approaches thee in great distress. He comes
plunged in grief, because he has been buried in sin, having
backslidden, and partaken of those vices and evil delights which merit
death. O master most compassionate, who art the upholder and defence of
all, receive the penitence and anguish of thy slave and
vassal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This prayer having concluded, the confessor then turned
to the penitent and thus addressed him: &ldquo;My son, thou art come
into the presence of that god who is the protector and upholder of all;
thou art come to him to confess thy evil vices and thy hidden
uncleannesses; thou art come to him to unbosom the secrets of thy
heart. Take care that thou omit nothing from the catalogue of thy sins
in the presence of our lord who is called Tezcatlipoca. It is certain
that thou art before him who is invisible and impalpable, thou who art
not worthy to be seen before him, or to speak with him....&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The allusions to Tezcatlipoca are, of course, to him in
the shape of Tlazolteotl. Having listened to a sermon by the confessor,
the penitent then confessed his misdeeds, after which the confessor
said: &ldquo;My son, thou hast before our lord god confessed in his
presence thy evil actions. I wish to say in his name that thou hast an
obligation to make. At the time when the goddesses called Ciuapipiltin
descend to earth during the celebration of the feast of the goddesses
of carnal things, whom they name Ixcuiname, thou shalt fast during four
days, punishing thy stomach and thy mouth. When the day of the feast of
the Ixcuiname arrives thou shalt scarify thy tongue with the small
thorns of the osier [called <i>teocalcacatl</i> or <i>tlazotl</i>], and
if that is not sufficient thou shalt do likewise to thine ears, the
whole for penitence, for the remission of thy sin, and as a meritorious
act. Thou wilt apply to thy tongue the middle of a spine of maguey, and
thou wilt scarify thy shoulders.... That done, thy sins will be
pardoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If the sins of the penitent were not very grave the
priest would enjoin upon him a fast of a more or less prolonged nature.
Only old men confessed crimes <i lang="la">in veneribus</i>, as the
punishment for such was death, and younger men had no desire to risk
the penalty involved, although the priests were enjoined to strict
secrecy.</p>
<p class="par">Father Burgoa describes very fully a ceremony of this
kind which came under his notice in 1652 in the Zapotec village of San
Francisco de Cajonos. He encountered on a tour of inspection an old
native <i>cacique</i>, or chief, of great refinement of manners and of
a stately presence, who dressed in costly garments after the Spanish
fashion, and who was regarded by the Indians with much veneration. This
man came to the priest for the purpose of reporting upon the progress
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>things spiritual and temporal in his village.
Burgoa recognised his urbanity and wonderful command of the Spanish
language, but perceived by certain signs that he had been taught to
look for by long experience that the man was a pagan. He communicated
his suspicions to the vicar of the village, but met with such
assurances of the <i>cacique&rsquo;s</i> soundness of faith that he
believed himself to be in error for once. Shortly afterwards, however,
a wandering Spaniard perceived the chief in a retired place in the
mountains performing idolatrous ceremonies, and aroused the monks, two
of whom accompanied him to the spot where the <i>cacique</i> had been
seen indulging in his heathenish practices. They found on the altar
&ldquo;feathers of many colours, sprinkled with blood which the Indians
had drawn from the veins under their tongues and behind their ears,
incense spoons and remains of copal, and in the middle a horrible stone
figure, which was the god to whom they had offered this sacrifice in
expiation of their sins, while they made their confessions to the
blasphemous priests, and cast off their sins in the following manner:
they had woven a kind of dish out of a strong herb, specially gathered
for this purpose, and casting this before the priest, said to him that
they came to beg mercy of their god, and pardon for their sins that
they had committed during that year, and that they brought them all
carefully enumerated. They then drew out of a cloth pairs of thin
threads made of dry maize husks, that they had tied two by two in the
middle with a knot, by which they represented their sins. They laid
these threads on the dishes of grass, and over them pierced their
veins, and let the blood trickle upon them, and the priest took these
offerings to the idol, and in a long speech he begged the god to
forgive these, his sons, their sins which were brought to him, and to
permit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>them to be joyful and hold feasts to him as
their god and lord. Then the priest came back to those who had
confessed, delivered a long discourse on the ceremonies they had still
to perform, and told them that the god had pardoned them and that they
might be glad again and sin anew.&rdquo;</p>

coronet of blue paper, decorated with green feathers. Her eyebrows were
of turquoise, set in as mosaic, and her garment was a nebulous

<p class="par first">Mixcoatl was the Aztec god of the chase, and was
probably a deity of the Otomi aborigines of Mexico. The name means
Cloud Serpent, and this originated the idea that Mixcoatl was a
representation of the tropical whirlwind. This is scarcely correct,
however, as the hunter-god is identified with the tempest and
thunder-cloud, and the lightning is supposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>represent his arrows. Like many other gods of
the chase, he is figured as having the characteristics of a deer or
rabbit. He is usually depicted as carrying a sheaf of arrows, to typify
thunderbolts. It may be that Mixcoatl was an air and thunder deity of
the Otomi, older in origin than either Quetzalcoatl or Tezcatlipoca,
and that his inclusion in the Nahua pantheon becoming necessary in
order to quieten Nahua susceptibilities, he received the status of god
of the chase. But, on the other hand, the Mexicans, unlike the
Peruvians, who adopted many foreign gods for political purposes, had
little regard for the feelings of other races, and only accepted an
alien deity into the native circle for some good reason, most probably
because they noted the omission of the figure in their own divine
system. Or, again, dread of a certain foreign god might force them to
adopt him as their own in the hope of placating him. Their worship of
Quetzalcoatl is perhaps an instance of this.</p>

the morning star, whose colours are depicted on his face and body. But
in all probability Camaxtli was a god of the chase, who in later times
was adopted as a god of war because of his possession of the lightning
dart, the symbol of divine warlike prowess. In the mythologies of North
America we find similar hunter-gods, who sometimes evolve into gods of
war for a like reason, and again gods of the chase who have all the
appearance and attributes of the creatures hunted. <span class=

god of medicine and healing, and therefore was often alluded to as the
brother of Macuilxochitl, the god of well-being or good luck. From the
account of the general appearance of his temple&mdash;an edifice of
painted boards&mdash;it would seem to have evolved from the primitive
tent or lodge of the medicine-man, or <i>shaman</i>. It contained
several water-jars called <i>tlilatl</i> (black water), the contents of
which were administered to children in bad health. The parents of
children who benefited from the treatment bestowed a feast on the
deity, whose idol was carried to the residence of the grateful father,
where ceremonial dances and oblations were made before it. It was then
thought that Ixtlilton descended to the courtyard to open fresh jars of
<i>pulque</i> liquor provided for the feasters, and the entertainment
concluded by an examination by the Aztec &AElig;sculapius of such of
the <i>pulque</i> jars dedicated to his service as stood in the
courtyard for everyday use. Should these be found in an unclean
condition, it was understood that the master of the house was a man of
evil life, and he was presented by the priest with a mask to hide his
face from his scoffing friends.</p>

<p class="par first">Omacatl was the Mexican god of festivity and joy.
The name signifies Two Reeds. He was worshipped chiefly by bon-vivants
and the rich, who celebrated him in splendid feasts and orgies. The
idol of the deity was invariably placed in the chamber where these
functions were to take place, and the Aztecs were known to regard it as
a heinous offence if anything derogatory to the god were performed
during the convivial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span>ceremony, or if any omission were made from
the prescribed form which these gatherings usually took. It was thought
that if the host had been in any way remiss Omacatl would appear to the
startled guests, and in tones of great severity upbraid him who had
given the feast, intimating that he would regard him no longer as a
worshipper and would henceforth abandon him. A terrible malady, the
symptoms of which were akin to those of falling-sickness, would shortly
afterwards seize the guests; but as such symptoms are not unlike those
connected with acute indigestion and other gastric troubles, it is
probable that the gourmets who paid homage to the god of good cheer may
have been suffering from a too strenuous instead of a lukewarm worship
of him. But the idea of communion which underlay so many of the Mexican
rites undoubtedly entered into the worship of Omacatl, for prior to a
banquet in his honour those who took part in it formed a great bone out
of maize paste, pretending that it was one of the bones of the deity
whose merry rites they were about to engage in. This they devoured,
washing it down with great draughts of <i>pulque</i>. The idol of
Omacatl was provided with a recess in the region of the stomach, and
into this provisions were stuffed. He was represented as a squatting
figure, painted black and white, crowned with a paper coronet, and hung
with coloured paper. A flower-fringed cloak and sceptre were the other
symbols of royalty worn by this Mexican Dionysus.</p>

been a deity of considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=

the Aztecs were marsh-dwellers and depended for their daily food on the
fish netted in the lakes and the birds snared in the reeds. They
credited the god with the invention of the harpoon or trident for
spearing fish and the fishing-rod and bird-net. The fishermen and
bird-catchers of Mexico held on occasion a special feast in honour of
Opochtli, at which a certain liquor called <i>octli</i> was consumed. A
procession was afterwards formed, in which marched old people who had
dedicated themselves to the worship of the god, probably because they
could obtain no other means of subsistence than that afforded by the
vocation of which he was tutelar and patron. He was represented as a
man painted black, his head decorated with the plumes of native wild
birds, and crowned by a paper coronet in the shape of a rose. He was
clad in green paper which fell to the knee, and was shod with white
sandals. In his left hand he held a shield painted red, having in the
centre a white flower with four petals placed crosswise, and in his
right hand he held a sceptre in the form of a cup.</p>

especially that connected with education and <span class=

possessed the power of selecting victims for sacrifice must have been
sufficient to place them in an almost unassailable position, and their
prophetic utterances, founded upon the art of divination&mdash;so great
a feature in the life of the Aztec people, who depended upon it from
the cradle to the grave&mdash;probably assisted them in maintaining
their hold upon the popular imagination. But withal the evidence of
unbiased Spanish ecclesiastics, such as Sahagun, tends to show that
they utilised their influence for good, and soundly instructed the
people under their charge in the cardinal virtues; &ldquo;in
short,&rdquo; says the venerable friar, &ldquo;to perform the duties
plainly pointed out by natural religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">The establishment of the national religion was, as
in the case of the medi&aelig;val Church in Europe, based upon a land
tenure from which the priestly class derived a substantial though,
considering their numbers, by no means inordinate revenue. The
principal temples possessed lands which sufficed for the maintenance of
the priests attached to them. There was, besides, a system of
first-fruits fixed by law for the priesthood, the surplusage therefrom
being distributed among the poor.</p>

<p class="par first">Education was entirely conducted by the
priesthood, which undertook the task in a manner highly creditable to
it, when consideration is given to surrounding conditions. Education
was, indeed, highly organised. It was divided into primary and
secondary grades. Boys were instructed by priests, girls by holy women
or &ldquo;nuns.&rdquo; The secondary schools <span class=

Mexicatl Teohuatzin (Mexican Lord of Divine Matters). He had a seat on
the emperor&rsquo;s council, and possessed power which was second only
to the royal authority. Next in rank to him was the high-priest of
Quetzalcoatl, who dwelt in almost entire seclusion, and who had
authority over his own caste only. This office was in all probability a
relic from &ldquo;Toltec&rdquo; times. The priests of Quetzalcoatl were
called by name after their tutelar deity. The lesser grades included
the Tlenamacac (Ordinary Priests), who were habited in black, and wore
their hair long, covering it with a kind of mantilla. The lowest order
was that of the Lamacazton (Little Priests), youths who were graduating
in the priestly office.</p>

an austere life of fasting, penance, and prayer, with constant
observance of an arduous and exacting ritual, which embraced sacrifice,
the upkeep of perpetual fires, the chanting of holy songs to the gods,
dances, and the superintendence of the ever-recurring festivals. They
were required to rise during the night to render praise, and to
maintain themselves in a condition of absolute cleanliness by means of
constant ablutions. We have seen that blood-offering&mdash;the
substitution of the part for the whole&mdash;was a common method of
sacrifice, and in this the priests engaged personally on frequent
occasions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=

certainly did not spare itself, and its outlook was perhaps only a

which succeeded it in the land.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mexican Idea of the Creation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;In the year and in the day of the
clouds,&rdquo; writes Garcia in his <i lang="es">Origin de los
Indias</i>, professing to furnish the reader with a translation of an
original Mixtec picture-manuscript, &ldquo;before ever were years or
days, the world lay in darkness. All things were orderless, and a water
covered the slime and ooze that the earth then was.&rdquo; This picture
is common to almost all American creation-stories.<a class="noteref"
id="xd22e2548src" href="#xd22e2548" name="xd22e2548src">1</a> The red
man in general believed the habitable globe to have been created from
the slime which arose above the primeval waters, and there can be no
doubt that the Nahua shared this belief. We encounter in Nahua myth two
beings of a bisexual nature, known to the Aztecs as
Ometecutli-Omeciuatl (Lords of Duality), who were represented as the
deities dominating the genesis of things, the beginning of the world.
We have already become acquainted with them in <a href="#ch2">Chapter
II</a> (see p. <a href="#pb104" class="pageref">104</a>), but we may
recapitulate. These beings, whose individual names were Tonacatecutli
and Tonacaciuatl (Lord and Lady of our Flesh), occupy the first place
in the calendar, a circumstance which makes it plain that they were
regarded as responsible for the origin of all created things. They were
invariably represented as being clothed in rich, variegated garments,
symbolical of light. Tonacatecutli, the male principle of creation or
world-generation, is often identified with the sun- or fire-god, but
there is no reason to consider him as symbolical of anything but the
sky. The firmament is almost universally regarded by American
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>aboriginal peoples as the male principle of the
cosmos, in contradistinction to the earth, which they think of as
possessing feminine attributes, and which is undoubtedly personified in
this instance by Tonacaciuatl.</p>
<p class="par">In North American Indian myths we find the Father Sky
brooding upon the Mother Earth, just as in early Greek creation-story
we see the elements uniting, the firmament impregnating the soil and
rendering it fruitful. To the savage mind the growth of crops and
vegetation proceeds as much from the sky as from the earth. Untutored
man beholds the fecundation of the soil by rain, and, seeing in
everything the expression of an individual and personal impulse,
regards the genesis of vegetable growth as analogous to human origin.
To him, then, the sky is the life-giving male principle, the
fertilising seed of which descends in rain. The earth is the receptive
element which hatches that with which the sky has impregnated her.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ixtlilxochitl&rsquo;s Legend of the Creation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the most complete creation-stories in
Mexican mythology is that given by the half-blood Indian author
Ixtlilxochitl, who, we cannot doubt, received it directly from native
sources. He states that the Toltecs credited a certain Tloque Nahuaque
(Lord of All Existence) with the creation of the universe, the stars,
mountains, and animals. At the same time he made the first man and
woman, from whom all the inhabitants of the earth are descended. This
&ldquo;first earth&rdquo; was destroyed by the &ldquo;water-sun.&rdquo;
At the commencement of the next epoch the Toltecs appeared, and after
many wanderings settled in Huehue Tlapallan (Very Old Tlapallan). Then
followed the second catastrophe, that of the &ldquo;wind-sun.&rdquo;
The remainder of the legend recounts how mighty earthquakes shook the
world and destroyed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>the earth-giants. These earth-giants
(Quinames) were analogous to the Greek Titans, and were a source of
great uneasiness to the Toltecs. In the opinion of the old historians
they were descended from the races who inhabited the more northerly
portion of Mexico.</p>

<h3 class="main">Creation-Story of the Mixtecs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It will be well to return for a moment to the
creation-story of the Mixtecs, which, if emanating from a somewhat
isolated people in the extreme south of the Mexican Empire, at least
affords us a vivid picture of what a folk closely related to the Nahua
race regarded as a veritable account of the creative process. When the
earth had arisen from the primeval waters, one day the deer-god, who
bore the surname Puma-Snake, and the beautiful deer-goddess, or
Jaguar-Snake, appeared. They had human form, and with their great
knowledge (that is, with their magic) they raised a high cliff over the
water, and built on it fine palaces for their dwelling. On the summit
of this cliff they laid a copper axe with the edge upward, and on this
edge the heavens rested. The palaces stood in Upper Mixteca, close to
Apoala, and the cliff was called Place where the Heavens Stood. The
gods lived happily together for many centuries, when it chanced that
two little boys were born to them, beautiful of form and skilled and
experienced in the arts. From the days of their birth they were named
Wind-Nine-Snake (Viento de Neuve Culebras) and Wind-Nine-Cave (Viento
de Neuve Cavernas). Much care was given to their education, and they
possessed the knowledge of how to change themselves into an eagle or a
snake, to make themselves invisible, and even to pass through solid
bodies.</p>
<p class="par">After a time these youthful gods decided to make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>an offering and a sacrifice to their ancestors.
Taking incense vessels made of clay, they filled them with tobacco, to
which they set fire, allowing it to smoulder. The smoke rose
heavenward, and that was the first offering (to the gods). Then they
made a garden with shrubs and flowers, trees and fruit-bearing plants,
and sweet-scented herbs. Adjoining this they made a grass-grown level
place (<i lang="es">un prado</i>), and equipped it with everything
necessary for sacrifice. The pious brothers lived contentedly on this
piece of ground, tilled it, burned tobacco, and with prayers, vows, and
promises they supplicated their ancestors to let the light appear, to
let the water collect in certain places and the earth be freed from its
covering (water), for they had no more than that little garden for
their subsistence. In order to strengthen their prayer they pierced
their ears and their tongues with pointed knives of flint, and
sprinkled the blood on the trees and plants with a brush of willow
twigs.</p>
<p class="par">The deer-gods had more sons and daughters, but there
came a flood in which many of these perished. After the catastrophe was
over the god who is called the Creator of All Things formed the heavens
and the earth, and restored the human race.</p>

<h3 class="main">Zapotec Creation-Myth</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Among the Zapotecs, a people related to the
Mixtecs, we find a similar conception of the creative process. Cozaana
is mentioned as the creator and maker of all beasts in the valuable
Zapotec dictionary of Father Juan de Cordova, and Huichaana as the
creator of men and fishes. Thus we have two separate creations for men
and animals. Cozaana would appear to apply to the sun as the creator of
all beasts, but, strangely enough, is alluded to in Cordova&rsquo;s
dictionary as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>&ldquo;procreatrix,&rdquo; whilst he is
undoubtedly a male deity. Huichaana, the creator of men and fishes, is,
on the other hand, alluded to as &ldquo;water,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
element of water,&rdquo; and &ldquo;goddess of generation.&rdquo; She
is certainly the Zapotec female part of the creative agency. In the
Mixtec creation-myth we can see the actual creator and the first pair
of tribal gods, who were also considered the progenitors of
animals&mdash;to the savage equal inhabitants of the world with
himself. The names of the brothers Nine-Snake and Nine-Cave undoubtedly
allude to light and darkness, day and night. It may be that these
deities are the same as Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl (the latter a Zapotec
deity), who were regarded as twins. In some ways Quetzalcoatl was
looked upon as a creator, and in the Mexican calendar followed the
Father and Mother, or original sexual deities, being placed in the
second section as the creator of the world and man.</p>

<p class="par first">Flood-myths, curiously enough, are of more common
occurrence among the Nahua and kindred peoples than creation-myths. The
Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg has translated one from the Codex
Chimalpopoca, a work in Nahuatl dating from the latter part of the
sixteenth century. It recounts the doings of the Mexican Noah and his
wife as follows:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And this year was that of Ce-calli, and on the
first day all was lost. The mountain itself was submerged in the water,
and the water remained tranquil for fifty-two springs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now toward the close of the year Titlacahuan had
forewarned the man named Nata and his wife Nena, saying, &lsquo;Make no
more <i>pulque</i>, but straightway hollow out a large cypress, and
enter it when in the month Tozoztli the water shall approach the
sky.&rsquo; They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>entered it, and when Titlacahuan had closed
the door he said, &lsquo;Thou shalt eat but a single ear of maize, and
thy wife but one also.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As soon as they had finished eating, they went
forth, and the water was tranquil; for the log did not move any more;
and opening it they saw many fish.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then they built a fire, rubbing together pieces
of wood, and they roasted fish. The gods Citallinicue and Citallatonac,
looking below, exclaimed, &lsquo;Divine Lord, what means that fire
below? Why do they thus smoke the heavens?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Straightway descended Titlacahuan-Tezcatlipoca,
and commenced to scold, saying, &lsquo;What is this fire doing
here?&rsquo; And seizing the fishes he moulded their hinder parts and
changed their heads, and they were at once transformed into
dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">But other legends apart from the creation-stories
of the world pure and simple deal with the origin of mankind. The
Aztecs believed that the first men emerged from a place known as
Chicomoztoc (The Seven Caverns), located north of Mexico. Various
writers have seen in these mythic recesses the fabulous &ldquo;seven
cities of Cibola&rdquo; and the Casas Grandes, ruins of extensive
character in the valley of the river Gila, and so forth. But the
allusion to the magical number seven in the myth demonstrates that the
entire story is purely imaginary and possesses no basis of fact. A
similar story occurs among the myths of the Kiche of Guatemala and the
Peruvians.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Coming to semi-historical times, we find a variety
of legends connected with the early story of the city of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>Mexico. These for the most part are of a weird
and gloomy character, and throw much light on the dark fanaticism of a
people which could immolate its children on the altars of implacable
gods. It is told how after the Aztecs had built the city of Mexico they
raised an altar to their war-god Huitzilopochtli. In general the lives
rendered to this most sanguinary of deities were those of prisoners of
war, but in times of public calamity he demanded the sacrifice of the
noblest in the land. On one occasion his oracle required that a royal
princess should be offered on the high altar. The Aztec king, either
possessing no daughters of his own or hesitating to sacrifice them,
sent an embassy to the monarch of Colhuacan to ask for one of his
daughters to become the symbolical mother of Huitzilopochtli. The King
of Colhuacan, suspecting nothing amiss, and highly flattered at the
distinction, delivered up the girl, who was escorted to Mexico, where
she was sacrificed with much pomp, her skin being flayed off to clothe
the priest who represented the deity in the festival. The unhappy
father was invited to this hideous orgy, ostensibly to witness his
daughter&rsquo;s deification. In the gloomy chambers of the
war-god&rsquo;s temple he was at first unable to mark the trend of the
horrid ritual. But, given a torch of copal-gum, he saw the officiating
priest clothed in his daughter&rsquo;s skin, receiving the homage of
the worshippers. Recognising her features, and demented with grief and
horror, he fled from the temple, a broken man, to spend the remainder
of his days in mourning for his murdered child.</p>

civilisation of Tezcuco, Mexico&rsquo;s neighbour and ally. We have
seen in the sketch of Nahua history which has been given how the
Tecpanecs overcame the Acolhuans of Tezcuco and slew their king about
the year 1418. Nezahualcoyotl (Fasting Coyote), the heir to the
Tezcucan throne, beheld the butchery of his royal father from the
shelter of a tree close by, and succeeded in making his escape from the
invaders. His subsequent thrilling adventures have been compared with
those of the Young Pretender after the collapse of the
&ldquo;Forty-five&rdquo; resistance. He had not enjoyed many days of
freedom when he was captured by those who had set out in pursuit of
him, and, being haled back to his native city, was cast into prison. He
found a friend in the governor of the place, who owed his position to
the prince&rsquo;s late father, and by means of his assistance he
succeeded in once more escaping from the hostile Tecpanecs. For aiding
Nezahualcoyotl, however, the governor promptly paid the penalty of
death. The royal family of Mexico interceded for the hunted youth, and
he was permitted to find an asylum at the Aztec court, whence he later
proceeded to his own city of Tezcuco, occupying apartments in the
palace where his father had once dwelt. For eight years he remained
there, existing unnoticed on the bounty of the Tecpanec chief who had
usurped the throne of his ancestors.</p>

refuge in flight. This advice he adopted, and returned to Tezcuco,
where, however, Maxtla set a snare for his life. A function which took
place in the evening afforded the tyrant his chance. But the
prince&rsquo;s preceptor frustrated the conspiracy, by means of
substituting for his charge a youth who strikingly resembled him. This
second failure exasperated Maxtla so much that he sent a military force
to Tezcuco, with orders to despatch Nezahualcoyotl without delay. But
the same vigilant person who had guarded the prince so well before
became apprised of his danger and advised him to fly. To this advice,
however, Nezahualcoyotl refused to listen, and resolved to await the
approach of his enemies.</p>

along with a fair estate and the hand of a noble lady, and the unhappy
prince was forced to seek safety in the mountainous country between
Tezcuco and Tlascala. He became a wretched outcast, a pariah lurking in
caves and woods, prowling about after nightfall in order to satisfy his
hunger, and seldom having a whole night&rsquo;s rest, because of the
vigilance of his enemies. Hotly pursued by them, he was compelled to
seek some curious places of concealment in order to save himself. On
one occasion he was hidden by some friendly soldiers inside a large
drum, and on another he was concealed beneath some <i>chia</i> stalks
by a girl who was engaged in reaping them. The loyalty of the Tezcucan
peasantry to their hunted prince was extraordinary, and rather than
betray his whereabouts to the creatures of Maxtla they on many
occasions suffered torture, and even death itself. At a time when his
affairs appeared most gloomy, however, Nezahualcoyotl experienced a
change of fortune. The tyrannous Maxtla had rendered himself highly
unpopular by his many oppressions, and the people in the territories he
had annexed were by no means contented under his rule.</p>

<p class="par first">Nezahualcoyotl is said to have erected a temple to
the Unknown God, and to have shown a marked preference for the worship
of one deity. In one of his poems he is credited with expressing the
following exalted sentiments: &ldquo;Let us aspire to that heaven where
all is eternal, and corruption cannot come. The horrors of the tomb are
the cradle of the sun, and the dark shadows of death are brilliant
lights for the stars.&rdquo; Unfortunately these ideas cannot be
verified as the undoubted sentiments of the royal bard of Tezcuco, and
we are regretfully forced to regard the attribution as spurious. We
must come to such a conclusion with very real disappointment, as to
discover an untutored <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=

<p class="par first">We find Nezahualcoyotl&rsquo;s later days stained
by an act which was unworthy of such a great monarch and wise man. His
eldest son, the heir to the crown, entered into an intrigue with one of
his father&rsquo;s wives, and dedicated many passionate poems to her,
to which she replied with equal ardour. The poetical correspondence was
brought before the king, who prized the lady highly because of her
beauty. Outraged in his most sacred feelings, Nezahualcoyotl had the
youth arraigned before the High Court, which passed sentence of death
upon him&mdash;a sentence which his father permitted to be carried out.
After his son&rsquo;s execution he shut himself up in his palace for
some months, and gave orders that the doors and windows of the unhappy
young man&rsquo;s residence should be built up so that never again
might its walls echo to the sound of a human voice.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Queen with a Hundred Lovers</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In his <i>History of the Chichimeca</i>
Ixtlilxochitl tells the following gruesome tale regarding the dreadful
fate of a favourite wife of Nezahualpilli, the son of Nezahualcoyotl:
When Axaiacatzin, King of Mexico, and other lords sent their daughters
to King Nezahualpilli, for him to choose one to be his queen and lawful
wife, whose son might succeed to the inheritance, she who had the
highest claims among them, for nobility of birth and rank, was
Chachiuhnenetzin, the young daughter of the Mexican king. She had been
brought up by the monarch in a separate palace, with great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>pomp, and with numerous attendants, as became
the daughter of so great a monarch. The number of servants attached to
her household exceeded two thousand. Young as she was, she was
exceedingly artful and vicious; so that, finding herself alone, and
seeing that her people feared her on account of her rank and
importance, she began to give way to an unlimited indulgence of her
power. Whenever she saw a young man who pleased her fancy she gave
secret orders that he should be brought to her, and shortly afterwards
he would be put to death. She would then order a statue or effigy of
his person to be made, and, adorning it with rich clothing, gold, and
jewellery, place it in the apartment in which she lived. The number of
statues of those whom she thus sacrificed was so great as to almost
fill the room. When the king came to visit her, and inquired respecting
these statues, she answered that they were her gods; and he, knowing
how strict the Mexicans were in the worship of their false deities,
believed her. But, as no iniquity can be long committed with entire
secrecy, she was finally found out in this manner: Three of the young
men, for some reason or other, she had left alive. Their names were
Chicuhcoatl, Huitzilimitzin, and Maxtla, one of whom was lord of
Tesoyucan and one of the grandees of the kingdom, and the other two
nobles of high rank. It happened that one day the king recognised on
the apparel of one of these a very precious jewel which he had given to
the queen; and although he had no fear of treason on her part it gave
him some uneasiness. Proceeding to visit her that night, her attendants
told him she was asleep, supposing that the king would then return, as
he had done at other times. But the affair of the jewel made him insist
on entering the chamber in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>which she slept; and, going to
wake her, he found only a statue in the bed, adorned with her hair, and
closely resembling her. Seeing this, and noticing that the attendants
around were in much trepidation and alarm, the king called his guards,
and, assembling all the people of the house, made a general search for
the queen, who was shortly found at an entertainment with the three
young lords, who were arrested with her. The king referred the case to
the judges of his court, in order that they might make an inquiry into
the matter and examine the parties implicated. These discovered many
individuals, servants of the queen, who had in some way or other been
accessory to her crimes&mdash;workmen who had been engaged in making
and adorning the statues, others who had aided in introducing the young
men into the palace, and others, again, who had put them to death and
concealed their bodies. The case having been sufficiently investigated,
the king despatched ambassadors to the rulers of Mexico and Tlacopan,
giving them information of the event, and signifying the day on which
the punishment of the queen and her accomplices was to take place; and
he likewise sent through the empire to summon all the lords to bring
their wives and their daughters, however young they might be, to be
witnesses of a punishment which he designed for a great example. He
also made a truce with all the enemies of the empire, in order that
they might come freely to see it. The time having arrived, the number
of people gathered together was so great that, large as was the city of
Tezcuco, they could scarcely all find room in it. The execution took
place publicly, in sight of the whole city. The queen was put to the
garrotte (a method of strangling by means of a rope twisted round a
stick), as well as her three gallants; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and, from their being
persons of high birth, their bodies were burned, together with the
effigies before mentioned. The other parties who had been accessory to
the crimes, who numbered more than two thousand persons, were also put
to the garrotte, and burned in a pit made for the purpose in a ravine
near a temple of the Idol of Adulterers. All applauded so severe and
exemplary a punishment, except the Mexican lords, the relatives of the
queen, who were much incensed at so public an example, and, although
for the time they concealed their resentment, meditated future revenge.
It was not without reason, says the chronicler, that the king
experienced this disgrace in his household, since he was thus punished
for an unworthy subterfuge made use of by his father to obtain his
mother as a wife!</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The period embraced by the life of this monarch
and his predecessor may be regarded as the Golden Age of Tezcuco, and
as semi-mythical. The palace of Nezahualcoyotl, according to the
account of Ixtlilxochitl, extended east and west for 1234 yards, and
for 978 yards from north to south. Enclosed by a high wall, it
contained two large courts, one used as the municipal market-place,
whilst the other was surrounded by administrative offices. A great hall
was set apart for the special use of poets and men of talent, who held
symposiums under its classic roof, or engaged in controversy in the
surrounding corridors. The chronicles of the kingdom were also kept in
this portion of the palace. The private apartments of the monarch
adjoined this College of Bards. They were gorgeous in the extreme,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>and their description rivals that of the fabled
Toltec city of Tollan. Rare stones and beautifully coloured plaster
mouldings alternated with wonderful tapestries of splendid feather-work
to make an enchanting display of florid decoration, and the gardens
which surrounded this marvellous edifice were delightful retreats,
where the lofty cedar and cypress overhung sparkling fountains and
luxurious baths. Fish darted hither and thither in the ponds, and the
aviaries echoed to the songs of birds of wonderful plumage.</p>

<h3 class="main">A Fairy Villa</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">According to Ixtlilxochitl, the king&rsquo;s villa
of Tezcotzinco was a residence which for sheer beauty had no equal in
Persian romance, or in those dream-tales of Araby which in childhood we
feel to be true, and in later life regretfully admit can only be known
again by sailing the sea of Poesy or penetrating the mist-locked
continent of Dream. The account of it which we have from the garrulous
half-blood reminds us of the stately pleasure-dome decreed by Kubla
Khan on the turbulent banks of the sacred Alph. A conical eminence was
laid out in hanging gardens reached by an airy flight of five hundred
and twenty marble steps. Gigantic walls contained an immense reservoir
of water, in the midst of which was islanded a great rock carved with
hieroglyphs describing the principal events in the reign of
Nezahualcoyotl. In each of three other reservoirs stood a marble statue
of a woman, symbolical of one of the three provinces of Tezcuco. These
great basins supplied the gardens beneath with a perennial flow of
water, so directed as to leap in cascades over artificial rockeries or
meander among mossy retreats with refreshing whisper, watering the
roots of odoriferous shrubs and flowers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>and winding in and
out of the shadow of the cypress woods. Here and there pavilions of
marble arose over porphyry baths, the highly polished stone of which
reflected the bodies of the bathers. The villa itself stood amidst a
wilderness of stately cedars, which shielded it from the torrid heat of
the Mexican sun. The architectural design of this delightful edifice
was light and airy in the extreme, and the perfume of the surrounding
gardens filled the spacious apartments with the delicious incense of
nature. In this paradise the Tezcucan monarch sought in the company of
his wives repose from the oppression of rule, and passed the lazy hours
in gamesome sport and dance. The surrounding woods afforded him the
pleasures of the chase, and art and nature combined to render his rural
retreat a centre of pleasant recreation as well as of repose and
refreshment.</p>

<h3 class="main">Disillusionment</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That some such palace existed on the spot in
question it would be absurd to deny, as its stupendous pillars and
remains still litter the terraces of Tezcotzinco. But, alas! we must
not listen to the vapourings of the untrustworthy Ixtlilxochitl, who
claims to have seen the place. It will be better to turn to a more
modern authority, who visited the site about seventy-five years ago,
and who has given perhaps the best account of it. He says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fragments of pottery, broken pieces of obsidian
knives and arrows, pieces of stucco, shattered terraces, and old walls
were thickly dispersed over its whole surface. We soon found further
advance on horseback impracticable, and, attaching our patient steeds
to the nopal bushes, we followed our Indian guide on foot, scrambling
upwards over rock and through tangled <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>brushwood. On gaining
the narrow ridge which connects the conical hill with one at the rear,
we found the remains of a wall and causeway; and, a little higher,
reached a recess, where, at the foot of a small precipice, overhung
with Indian fig and grass, the rock had been wrought by hand into a
flat surface of large dimensions. In this perpendicular wall of rock a
carved Toltec calendar existed formerly; but the Indians, finding the
place visited occasionally by foreigners from the capital, took it into
their heads that there must be a silver vein there, and straightway set
to work to find it, obliterating the sculpture, and driving a level
beyond it into the hard rock for several yards. From this recess a few
minutes&rsquo; climb brought us to the summit of the hill. The sun was
on the point of setting over the mountains on the other side of the
valley, and the view spread beneath our feet was most glorious. The
whole of the lake of Tezcuco, and the country and mountains on both
sides, lay stretched before us.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, however disposed, we dare not stop long to
gaze and admire, but, descending a little obliquely, soon came to the
so-called bath, two singular basins, of perhaps two feet and a half
diameter, cut into a bastion-like solid rock, projecting from the
general outline of the hill, and surrounded by smooth carved seats and
grooves, as we supposed&mdash;for I own the whole appearance of the
locality was perfectly inexplicable to me. I have a suspicion that many
of these horizontal planes and grooves were contrivances to aid their
astronomical observations, one like that I have mentioned having been
discovered by de Gama at Chapultepec.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As to Montezuma&rsquo;s Bath, it might be his
foot-bath if you will, but it would be a moral impossibility for any
monarch of larger dimensions than Oberon to take a duck in it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The mountain bears the marks of human industry to
its very apex, many of the blocks of porphyry of which it is composed
being quarried into smooth horizontal planes. It is impossible to say
at present what portion of the surface is artificial or not, such is
the state of confusion observable in every part.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By what means nations unacquainted with the use
of iron constructed works of such a smooth polish, in rocks of such
hardness, it is extremely difficult to say. Many think tools of mixed
tin and copper were employed; others, that patient friction was one of
the main means resorted to. Whatever may have been the real
appropriation of these inexplicable ruins, or the epoch of their
construction, there can be no doubt but the whole of this hill, which I
should suppose rises five or six hundred feet above the level of the
plain, was covered with artificial works of one kind or another. They
are doubtless rather of Toltec than of Aztec origin, and perhaps with
still more probability attributable to a people of an age yet more
remote.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Noble Tlascalan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As may be imagined regarding a community where
human sacrifice was rife, tales concerning those who were consigned to
this dreadful fate were abundant. Perhaps the most striking of these is
that relating to the noble Tlascalan warrior Tlalhuicole, who was
captured in combat by the troops of Montezuma. Less than a year before
the Spaniards arrived in Mexico war broke out between the Huexotzincans
and the Tlascalans, to the former of whom the Aztecs acted as allies.
On the battlefield there was captured by guile a very valiant Tlascalan
leader called Tlalhuicole, so renowned for his prowess that the mere
mention of his name was generally sufficient to deter any Mexican hero
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>attempting his capture. He was brought to Mexico
in a cage, and presented to the Emperor Montezuma, who, on learning of
his name and renown, gave him his liberty and overwhelmed him with
honours. He further granted him permission to return to his own
country, a boon he had never before extended to any captive. But
Tlalhuicole refused his freedom, and replied that he would prefer to be
sacrificed to the gods, according to the usual custom. Montezuma, who
had the highest regard for him, and prized his life more than any
sacrifice, would not consent to his immolation. At this juncture war
broke out between Mexico and the Tarascans, and Montezuma announced the
appointment of Tlalhuicole as chief of the expeditionary force. He
accepted the command, marched against the Tarascans, and, having
totally defeated them, returned to Mexico laden with an enormous booty
and crowds of slaves. The city rang with his triumph. The emperor
begged him to become a Mexican citizen, but he replied that on no
account would he prove a traitor to his country. Montezuma then once
more offered him his liberty, but he strenuously refused to return to
Tlascala, having undergone the disgrace of defeat and capture. He
begged Montezuma to terminate his unhappy existence by sacrificing him
to the gods, thus ending the dishonour he felt in living on after
having undergone defeat, and at the same time fulfilling the highest
aspiration of his life&mdash;to die the death of a warrior on the stone
of combat. Montezuma, himself the noblest pattern of Aztec chivalry,
touched at his request, could not but agree with him that he had chosen
the most fitting fate for a hero, and ordered him to be chained to the
stone of combat, the blood-stained <i>temalacatl</i>. The most renowned
of the Aztec warriors were pitted against him, and the emperor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>himself graced the sanguinary tournament with
his presence. Tlalhuicole bore himself in the combat like a lion, slew
eight warriors of renown, and wounded more than twenty. But at last he
fell, covered with wounds, and was haled by the exulting priests to the
altar of the terrible war-god Huitzilopochtli, to whom his heart was
offered up.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is only occasionally that we encounter either
the gods or supernatural beings of any description in Mexican myth. But
occasionally we catch sight of such beings as the Ciuapipiltin
(Honoured Women), the spirits of those women who had died in childbed,
a death highly venerated by the Mexicans, who regarded the woman who
perished thus as the equal of a warrior who met his fate in battle.
Strangely enough, these spirits were actively malevolent, probably
because the moon-goddess (who was also the deity of evil exhalations)
was evil in her tendencies, and they were regarded as possessing an
affinity to her. It was supposed that they afflicted infants with
various diseases, and Mexican parents took every precaution not to
permit their offspring out of doors on the days when their influence
was believed to be strong. They were said to haunt the cross-roads, and
even to enter the bodies of weakly people, the better to work their
evil will. The insane were supposed to be under their especial
visitation. Temples were raised at the cross-roads in order to placate
them, and loaves of bread, shaped like butterflies, were dedicated to
them. They were represented as having faces of a dead white, and as
blanching their arms and hands with a white powder known as
<i>tisatl</i>. Their eyebrows were of a golden hue, and their raiment

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the weirdest legends in Mexican tradition
recounts how Papantzin, the sister of Montezuma II, returned from her
tomb to prophesy to her royal brother concerning his doom and the fall
of his empire at the hands of the Spaniards. On taking up the reins of
government Montezuma had married this lady to one of his most
illustrious servants, the governor of Tlatelulco, and after his death
it would appear that she continued to exercise his almost viceregal
functions and to reside in his palace. In course of time she died, and
her obsequies were attended by the emperor in person, accompanied by
the greatest personages of his court and kingdom. The body was interred
in a subterranean vault of his own palace, in close proximity to the
royal baths, which stood in a sequestered part of the extensive grounds
surrounding the royal residence. The entrance to the vault was secured
by a stone slab of moderate weight, and when the numerous ceremonies
prescribed for the interment of a royal personage had been completed
the emperor and his suite retired. At daylight next morning one of the
royal children, a little girl of some six years of age, having gone
into the garden to seek her governess, espied the Princess Papan
standing near the baths. The princess, who was her aunt, called to her,
and requested her to bring her governess to her. The child did as she
was bid, but her governess, thinking that imagination had played her a
trick, paid little attention to what she said. As the child persisted
in her statement, the governess at last followed her into the garden,
where she saw Papan sitting on one of the steps of the baths.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>The sight of the supposed dead princess filled
the woman with such terror that she fell down in a swoon. The child
then went to her mother&rsquo;s apartment, and detailed to her what had
happened. She at once proceeded to the baths with two of her
attendants, and at sight of Papan was also seized with affright. But
the princess reassured her, and asked to be allowed to accompany her to
her apartments, and that the entire affair should for the present be
kept absolutely secret. Later in the day she sent for
Ti&ccedil;otzicatzin, her major-domo, and requested him to inform the
emperor that she desired to speak with him immediately on matters of
the greatest importance. The man, terrified, begged to be excused from
the mission, and Papan then gave orders that her uncle Nezahualpilli,
King of Tezcuco, should be communicated with. That monarch, on
receiving her request that he should come to her, hastened to the
palace. The princess begged him to see the emperor without loss of time
and to entreat him to come to her at once. Montezuma heard his story
with surprise mingled with doubt. Hastening to his sister, he cried as
he approached her: &ldquo;Is it indeed you, my sister, or some evil
demon who has taken your likeness?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is I indeed, your
Majesty,&rdquo; she replied. Montezuma and the exalted personages who
accompanied him then seated themselves, and a hush of expectation fell
upon all as they were addressed by the princess in the following
words:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen attentively to what I am about to relate
to you. You have seen me dead, buried, and now behold me alive again.
By the authority of our ancestors, my brother, I am returned from the
dwellings of the dead to prophesy to you certain things of prime
importance.</p>

<h3 class="main">Papantzin&rsquo;s Story</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;At the moment after death I found myself in
a spacious valley, which appeared to have neither commencement nor end,
and was surrounded by lofty mountains. Near the middle I came upon a
road with many branching paths. By the side of the valley there flowed
a river of considerable size, the waters of which ran with a loud
noise. By the borders of this I saw a young man clothed in a long robe,
fastened with a diamond, and shining like the sun, his visage bright as
a star. On his forehead was a sign in the figure of a cross. He had
wings, the feathers of which gave forth the most wonderful and glowing
reflections and colours. His eyes were as emeralds, and his glance was
modest. He was fair, of beautiful aspect and imposing presence. He took
me by the hand and said: &lsquo;Come hither. It is not yet time for you
to cross the river. You possess the love of God, which is greater than
you know or can comprehend.&rsquo; He then conducted me through the
valley, where I espied many heads and bones of dead men. I then beheld
a number of black folk, horned, and with the feet of deer. They were
engaged in building a house, which was nearly completed. Turning toward
the east for a space, I beheld on the waters of the river a vast number
of ships manned by a great host of men dressed differently from
ourselves. Their eyes were of a clear grey, their complexions ruddy,
they carried banners and ensigns in their hands and wore helmets on
their heads. They called themselves &lsquo;Sons of the Sun.&rsquo; The
youth who conducted me and caused me to see all these things said that
it was not yet the will of the gods that I should cross the river, but
that I was to be reserved to behold the future with my own eyes, and to
enjoy the benefits of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the faith which these strangers
brought with them; that the bones I beheld on the plain were those of
my countrymen who had died in ignorance of that faith, and had
consequently suffered great torments; that the house being builded by
the black folk was an edifice prepared for those who would fall in
battle with the seafaring strangers whom I had seen; and that I was
destined to return to my compatriots to tell them of the true faith,
and to announce to them what I had seen that they might profit
thereby.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Montezuma hearkened to these matters in silence, and
felt greatly troubled. He left his sister&rsquo;s presence without a
word, and, regaining his own apartments, plunged into melancholy
thoughts.</p>
<p class="par">Papantzin&rsquo;s resurrection is one of the best
authenticated incidents in Mexican history, and it is a curious fact
that on the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadores one of the first
persons to embrace Christianity and receive baptism at their hands was
the Princess Papan.</p>

<p class="par first">It was to the Maya&mdash;the people who occupied
the territory between the isthmus of Tehuantepec and
Nicaragua&mdash;that the civilisation of Central America owed most. The
language they spoke was quite distinct from the Nahuatl spoken by the
Nahua of Mexico, and in many respects their customs and habits were
widely different from those of the people of Anahuac. It will be
remembered that the latter were the heirs of an older civilisation,
that, indeed, they had entered the valley of Mexico as savages, and
that practically all they knew of the arts of culture was taught them
by the remnants of the people whom they dispossessed. It was not thus
with the Maya. Their arts and industries were of their own invention,
and bore the stamp of an origin of considerable antiquity. They were,
indeed, the supreme intellectual race of America, and on their coming
into contact with the Nahua that people assimilated sufficient of their
culture to raise them several grades in the scale of civilisation.</p>

<h3 class="main">Were the Maya Toltecs?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It has already been stated that many antiquarians
see in the Maya those Toltecs who because of the inroads of barbarous
tribes quitted their native land of Anahuac and journeyed southward to
seek a new home in Chiapas and Yucatan. It would be idle to attempt to
uphold or refute such a theory in the absolute dearth of positive
evidence for or against it. The architectural remains of the older race
of Anahuac do not bear any striking likeness to Maya forms, and if the
mythologies of the two peoples are in some particulars alike, that may
well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>be accounted for by their mutual adoption of
deities and religious customs. On the other hand, it is distinctly
noteworthy that the cult of the god Quetzalcoatl, which was regarded in
Mexico as of alien origin, had a considerable vogue among the Maya and
their allied races.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Maya Kingdom</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the arrival of the Spaniards (after the
celebrated march of Cort&eacute;s from Mexico to Central America) the
Maya were divided into a number of subsidiary states which remind us
somewhat of the numerous little kingdoms of Palestine. That these had
hived off from an original and considerably greater state there is good
evidence to show, but internal dissension had played havoc with the
polity of the central government of this empire, the disintegration of
which had occurred at a remote period. In the semi-historical legends
of this people we catch glimpses of a great kingdom, occasionally
alluded to as the &ldquo;Kingdom of the Great Snake,&rdquo; or the
empire of Xibalba, realms which have been identified with the ruined
city-centres of Palenque and Mitla. These identifications must be
regarded with caution, but the work of excavation will doubtless sooner
or later assist theorists in coming to conclusions which will admit of
no doubt. The sphere of Maya civilisation and influence is pretty well
marked, and embraces the peninsula of Yucatan, Chiapas, to the isthmus
of Tehuantepec on the north, and the whole of Guatemala to the
boundaries of the present republic of San Salvador. The true nucleus of
Maya civilisation, however, must be looked for in that part of Chiapas
which skirts the banks of the Usumacinta river and in the valleys of
its tributaries. Here Maya art and architecture reached a height of
splendour unknown elsewhere, and in this district, too, the strange
Maya system of writing had its most skilful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>exponents. Although the arts and industries of
the several districts inhabited by people of Maya race exhibited many
superficial differences, these are so small as to make us certain of
the fact that the various areas inhabited by Maya stock had all drawn
their inspiration toward civilisation from one common nucleus, and had
equally passed through a uniform civilisation and drawn sap from an
original culture-centre.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Maya Dialects</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Perhaps the most effectual method of
distinguishing the various branches of the Maya people from one another
consists in dividing them into linguistic groups. The various dialects
spoken by the folk of Maya origin, although they exhibit some
considerable difference, yet display strongly that affinity of
construction and resemblance in root which go to prove that they all
emanate from one common mother-tongue. In Chiapas the Maya tongue
itself is the current dialect, whilst in Guatemala no less than
twenty-four dialects are in use, the principal of which are the Quiche,
or Kiche, the Kakchiquel, the Zutugil, Coxoh Chol, and Pipil. These
dialects and the folk who speak them are sufficient to engage our
attention, as in them are enshrined the most remarkable myths and
legends of the race, and by the men who used them were the greatest
acts in Maya history achieved.</p>

<h3 class="main">Whence Came the Maya?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Whence came these folk, then, who raised a
civilisation by no means inferior to that of ancient Egypt, which, if
it had had scope, would have rivalled in its achievements the glory of
old Assyria? We cannot tell. The mystery of its entrance into the land
is as deep as the mystery of the ancient forests which now bury the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>remnants of its mighty monuments and enclose its
temples in impenetrable gloom. Generations of antiquarians have
attempted to trace the origin of this race to Egypt, Ph&oelig;nicia,
China, Burma. But the manifest traces of indigenous American origin are
present in all its works, and the writers who have beheld in these
likenesses to the art of Asiatic or African peoples have been
grievously misled by superficial resemblances which could not have
betrayed any one who had studied Maya affinities deeply.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Civilisation of the Maya</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the risk of repetition it is essential to point
out that civilisation, which was a newly acquired thing with the Nahua
peoples, was not so with the Maya. They were indisputably an older
race, possessing institutions which bore the marks of generations of
use, whereas the Nahua had only too obviously just entered into their
heritage of law and order. When we first catch sight of the Maya
kingdoms they are in the process of disintegration. Such strong young
blood as the virile folk of Anahuac possessed did not flow in the veins
of the people of Yucatan and Guatemala. They were to the Nahua much as
the ancient Assyrians were to the hosts of Israel at the entrance of
the latter into national existence. That there was a substratum of
ethnical and cultural relationship, however, it would be impossible to
deny. The institutions, architecture, habits, even the racial cast of
thought of the two peoples, bore such a general resemblance as to show
that many affinities of blood and cultural relationship existed between
them. But it will not do to insist too strongly upon these. It may be
argued with great probability that these relationships and likenesses
exist because of the influence of Maya civilisation upon Mexican alone,
or from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>inheritance by both Mexican and Maya people of a
still older culture of which we are ignorant, and the proofs of which
lie buried below the forests of Guatemala or the sands of Yucatan.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Zapotecs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The influence of the Maya upon the Nahua was a
process of exceeding slowness. The peoples who divided them one from
another were themselves benefited by carrying Maya culture into
Anahuac, or rather it might be said that they constituted a sort of
filter through which the southern civilisation reached the northern.
These peoples were the Zapotecs, the Mixtecs, and the Kuikatecs, by far
the most important of whom were the first-mentioned. They partook of
the nature and civilisation of both races, and were in effect a border
people who took from and gave to both Maya and Nahua, much as the Jews
absorbed and disseminated the cultures of Egypt and Assyria. They were,
however, of Nahua race, but their speech bears the strongest marks of
having borrowed extensively from the Maya vocabulary. For many
generations these people wandered in a nomadic condition from Maya to
Nahua territory, thus absorbing the customs, speech, and mythology of
each.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Huasteca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But we should be wrong if we thought that the Maya
had never attempted to expand, and had never sought new homes for their
surplus population. That they had is proved by an outlying tribe of
Maya, the Huasteca, having settled at the mouth of the Panuco river, on
the north coast of Mexico. The presence of this curious ethnological
island has of course given rise to all sorts of queer theories
concerning Toltec <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>relationship, whereas it simply intimates
that before the era of Nahua expansion the Maya had attempted to
colonise the country to the north of their territories, but that their
efforts in this direction had been cut short by the influx of savage
Nahua, against whom they found themselves unable to contend.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Type of Maya Civilisation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Did the civilisation of the Maya differ, then, in
type from that of the Nahua, or was it merely a larger expression of
that in vogue in Anahuac? We may take it that the Nahua civilisation
characterised the culture of Central America in its youth, whilst that
of the Maya displayed it in its bloom, and perhaps in its senility. The
difference was neither essential nor radical, but may be said to have
arisen for the most part from climatic and kindred causes. The climate
of Anahuac is dry and temperate, that of Yucatan and Guatemala is
tropical, and we shall find even such religious conceptions of the two
peoples as were drawn from a common source varying from this very
cause, and coloured by differences in temperature and rainfall.</p>

<h3 class="main">Maya History</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Before entering upon a consideration of the art,
architecture, or mythology of this strange and highly interesting
people it will be necessary to provide the reader with a brief sketch
of their history. Such notices of this as exist in English are few, and
their value doubtful. For the earlier history of the people of Maya
stock we depend almost wholly upon tradition and architectural remains.
The net result of the evidence wrung from these is that the Maya
civilisation was one and homogeneous, and that all the separate states
must have at one period passed through a uniform <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>condition of culture, to which they were all
equally debtors, and that this is sufficient ground for the belief that
all were at one time beneath the sway of one central power. For the
later history we possess the writings of the Spanish fathers, but not
in such profusion as in the case of Mexico. In fact the trustworthy
original authors who deal with Maya history can almost be counted on
the fingers of one hand. We are further confused in perusing these,
and, indeed, throughout the study of Maya history, by discovering that
many of the sites of Maya cities are designated by Nahua names. This is
due to the fact that the Spanish conquerors were guided in their
conquest of the Maya territories by Nahua, who naturally applied
Nahuatlac designations to those sites of which the Spaniards asked the
names. These appellations clung to the places in question; hence the
confusion, and the blundering theories which would read in these
place-names relics of Aztec conquest.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Nucleus of Maya Power</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As has been said, the nucleus of Maya power and
culture is probably to be found in that part of Chiapas which slopes
down from the steep Cordilleras. Here the ruined sites of Palenque,
Piedras Negras, and Ocosingo are eloquent of that opulence of
imagination and loftiness of conception which go hand in hand with an
advanced culture. The temples and palaces of this region bear the stamp
of a dignity and consciousness of metropolitan power which are scarcely
to be mistaken, so broad, so free is their architectural conception, so
full to overflowing the display of the desire to surpass. But upon the
necessities of religion and central organisation alone was this
architectural artistry lavished. Its dignities were not profaned by its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>application to mere domestic uses, for, unless
what were obviously palaces are excepted, not a single example of Maya
domestic building has survived. This is of course accounted for by the
circumstance that the people were sharply divided into the aristocratic
and labouring classes, the first of which was closely identified with
religion or kingship, and was housed in the ecclesiastical or royal
buildings, whilst those of less exalted rank were perforce content with
the shelter afforded by a hut built of perishable materials, the traces
of which have long since passed away. The temples were, in fact, the
nuclei of the towns, the centres round which the Maya communities were
grouped, much in the same manner as the cities of Europe in the Middle
Ages clustered and grew around the shadow of some vast cathedral or
sheltering stronghold.</p>

<h3 class="main">Early Race Movements</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We shall leave the consideration of Maya tradition
until we come to speak of Maya myth proper, and attempt to glean from
the chaos of legend some veritable facts connected with Maya history.
According to a manuscript of Kuikatec origin recently discovered, it is
probable that a Nahua invasion of the Maya states of Chiapas and
Tabasco took place about the ninth century of our era, and we must for
the present regard that as the starting-point of Maya history. The
south-western portions of the Maya territory were agitated about the
same time by race movements, which turned northward toward Tehuantepec,
and, flowing through Guatemala, came to rest in Acalan, on the borders
of Yucatan, retarded, probably, by the inhospitable and waterless
condition of that country. This Nahua invasion probably had the effect
of driving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>the more peaceful Maya from their northerly
settlements and forcing them farther south. Indeed, evidence is not
wanting to show that the warlike Nahua pursued the pacific Maya into
their new retreats, and for a space left them but little peace. This
struggle it was which finally resulted in the breaking up of the Maya
civilisation, which even at that relatively remote period had reached
its apogee, its several races separating into numerous city-states,
which bore a close political resemblance to those of Italy on the
downfall of Rome. At this period, probably, began the cleavage between
the Maya of Yucatan and those of Guatemala, which finally resolved
itself into such differences of speech, faith, and architecture as
almost to constitute them different peoples.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Settlement of Yucatan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As the Celts of Wales and Scotland were driven
into the less hospitable regions of their respective countries by the
inroads of the Saxons, so was one branch of the Maya forced to seek
shelter in the almost desert wastes of Yucatan. There can be no doubt
that the Maya did not take to this barren and waterless land of their
own accord. Thrifty and possessed of high agricultural attainments,
this people would view with concern a removal to a sphere so forbidding
after the rich and easily developed country they had inhabited for
generations. But the inexorable Nahua were behind, and they were a
peaceful folk, unused to the horrors of savage warfare. So, taking
their courage in both hands, they wandered into the desert. Everything
points to a late occupation of Yucatan by the Maya, and architectural
effort exhibits deterioration, evidenced in a high conventionality of
design and excess of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>ornamentation. Evidences of Nahua influence
also are not wanting, a fact which is eloquent of the later period of
contact which is known to have occurred between the peoples, and which
alone is almost sufficient to fix the date of the settlement of the
Maya in Yucatan. It must not be thought that the Maya in Yucatan formed
one homogeneous state recognising a central authority. On the contrary,
as is often the case with colonists, the several Maya bands of
immigrants formed themselves into different states or kingdoms, each
having its own separate traditions. It is thus a matter of the highest
difficulty to so collate and criticise these traditions as to construct
a history of the Maya race in Yucatan. As may be supposed, we find the
various city-sites founded by divine beings who play a more or less
important part in the Maya pantheon. Kukulcan, for example, is the
first king of Mayapan, whilst Itzamna figures as the founder of the
state of Itzamal. The gods were the spiritual leaders of these bands of
Maya, just as Jehovah was the spiritual leader and guide of the
Israelites in the desert. One is therefore not surprised to find in the
<i>Popol Vuh</i>, the saga of the Kiche-Maya of Guatemala, that the god
Tohil (The Rumbler) guided them to the site of the first Kiche city.
Some writers on the subject appear to think that the incidents in such
migration myths, especially the tutelage and guidance of the tribes by
gods and the descriptions of desert scenery which they contain, suffice
to stamp them as mere native versions of the Book of Exodus, or at the
best myths sophisticated by missionary influence. The truth is that the
conditions of migration undergone by the Maya were similar to those
described in the Scriptures, and by no means merely reflect the Bible
story, as short-sighted collators of both aver. <span class=

from Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, soon raised their state into a position
of prominence among the surrounding cities. Those who had founded
Chichen-Itza, and who were known as Itzaes, were, on the other hand, a
caste of warriors who do not appear to have cherished the priestly
function with such assiduity. The rulers of the Itzaes, who were known
as the Tutul Xius, seem to have come, according to their traditions,
from the western Maya states, perhaps from Nonohualco in Tabasco.
Arriving from thence at the southern extremity of Yucatan, they founded
the city of Ziyan Caan, on Lake Bacalar, which had a period of
prosperity for at least a couple of generations. At the expiry of that
period for some unaccountable reason they migrated northward, perhaps
because at that particular time the incidence of power was shifting
toward Northern Yucatan, and took up their abode in Chichen-Itza,
eventually the sacred city of the Maya, which they founded.</p>

overthrown by the Cocomes, who resolved it into a dependency,
permitting the governors and a certain number of the people to depart
elsewhere.</p>

Champoton, where they reigned for nearly 300 years. From this new
centre, with the aid of Nahua mercenaries, they commenced an extension
of territory northward, and entered into diplomatic relations with the
heads of the other Maya states. It was at this time that they built
Uxmal, and their power became so extensive that they reconquered the
territory they had lost to the Cocomes. This on the whole appears to
have been a period when the arts flourished under an enlightened
policy, which knew how to make and keep friendly relations with
surrounding states, and the splendid network of roads with which the
country was covered and the many evidences of architectural excellence
go to prove that the race had had leisure to achieve much in art and
works of utility. Thus the city of Chichen-Itza was linked up with the
island of Cozumel by a highway whereon thousands of pilgrims plodded to
the temples of the gods of wind and moisture. From Itzamal, too, roads
branched in every direction, in order that the people should have every
facility for reaching the chief shrine of the country situated there.
But the hand of the Cocomes was heavy upon the other Maya states which
were tributary to them. As in the Yucatan of to-day, where the wretched
henequen-picker leads the life of a veritable slave, a crushing system
of helotage obtained. The Cocomes made heavy demands upon the Tutul
Xius, who in their turn sweated the hapless folk under their sway past
the bounds of human endurance. As in all tottering civilisations, the
feeling of responsibility among the upper classes became dormant, and
they abandoned themselves to the pleasures of life without thought of
the morrow. Morality ceased to be regarded as a virtue, and rottenness
was at the core of Maya life. Discontent quickly spread on every hand.

by the tyranny of a dissolute oligarchy, the subject states rose in
revolt. The Cocomes surrounded themselves by Nahua mercenaries, who
succeeded in beating off the first wave of revolt, led by the king or
regulus of Uxmal, who was defeated, and whose people in their turn rose
against him, a circumstance which ended in the abandonment of the city
of Uxmal. Once more were the Tutul Xius forced to go on pilgrimage, and
this time they founded the city of Mani, a mere shadow of the splendour

<p class="par first">If the aristocracy of the Cocomes was composed of
weaklings, its ruler was made of sterner stuff. Hunac Eel, who
exercised royal sway over this people, and held in subjection the
lesser principalities of Yucatan, was not only a tyrant of harsh and
vindictive temperament, but a statesman of judgment and experience, who
courted the assistance of the neighbouring Nahua, whom he employed in
his campaign against the new assailant of his absolutism, the ruler of
Chichen-Itza. Mustering a mighty host of his vassals, Hunac Eel marched
against the devoted city whose prince had dared to challenge his
supremacy, and succeeded in inflicting a crushing defeat upon its
inhabitants. But apparently the state was permitted to remain under the
sovereignty of its native princes. The revolt, however, merely
smouldered, and in the kingdom of Mayapan itself, the territory of the
Cocomes, the fires of revolution began to blaze. This state of things
continued for nearly a century. Then the crash came. The enemies of the
Cocomes effected a junction. The people of Chichen-Itza <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>joined hands with the Tutul Xius, who had sought
refuge in the central highlands of Yucatan and those city-states which
clustered around the mother-city of Mayapan. A fierce concerted attack
was made, beneath which the power of the Cocomes crumpled up
completely. Not one stone was left standing upon another by the
exasperated allies, who thus avenged the helotage of nearly 300 years.
To this event the date 1436 is assigned, but, like most dates in Maya
history, considerable uncertainty must be attached to it.</p>

impenetrable forest.</p>
<p class="par">It would not appear that the city of Chichen-Itza, the
prince of which was ever the head and front of the rebellion against
the Cocomes, profited in any way from the fall of the suzerain power.
On the contrary, tradition has it that the town was abandoned by its
inhabitants, and left to crumble into the ruinous state in which the
Spaniards found it on their entrance into the country. The probability
is that its people quitted it because of the repeated attacks made upon
it by the Cocomes, who saw in it the chief obstacle to their universal
sway; and this is supported by tradition, which tells that a prince of
Chichen-Itza, worn out with conflict and internecine strife, left it to
seek the cradle of the Maya race in the land of the setting sun.
Indeed, it is further stated that this prince founded the city of
Peten-Itza, on the lake of Peten, in Guatemala. <span class=

the Kakchiquels, first made their way into that territory, they
probably found there a race of Maya origin of a type more advanced and
possessed of more ancient traditions than themselves. By their
connection with this folk they greatly benefited in the direction of
artistic achievement as well as in the industrial arts. Concerning
these people we have a large body of tradition in the <i>Popol Vuh</i>,
a native chronicle, the contents of which will be fully dealt with in
the chapter relating to the Maya myths and legendary matter. We cannot
deal with it as a veritable historical document, but there is little
doubt that a basis of fact exists behind the tradition it contains. The
difference between the language of these people and that of their
brethren in Yucatan was, as has been said, one of dialect only, and a
like slight distinction is found in their mythology, caused, doubtless,
by the incidence of local conditions, and resulting in part from the
difference between a level and comparatively waterless land and one of
a semi-mountainous character covered with thick forests. We shall note
further differences when we come to examine the art and architecture of
the Maya race, and to compare those of its two most distinctive
branches.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was to the city of Tulan, probably in Tabasco,
that the Maya of Guatemala referred as being the starting-point of all
their migrations. We must not confound this place with the Tollan of
the Mexican traditions. It is possible that the name may in both cases
be derived from a root meaning a place from which a tribe set forth, a
starting-place, but geographical connection there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>is
none. From here Nima-Kiche, the great Kiche, started on his migration
to the mountains, accompanied by his three brothers. Tulan, says the
<i>Popol Vuh</i>, had been a place of misfortune to man, for he had
suffered much from cold and hunger, and, as at the building of Babel,
his speech was so confounded that the first four Kiches and their wives
were unable to comprehend one another. Of course this is a native myth
created to account for the difference in dialect between the various
branches of the Maya folk, and can scarcely have any foundation in
fact, as the change in dialect would be a very gradual process. The
brothers, we are told, divided the land so that one received the
districts of Mames and Pocomams, another Verapaz, and the third
Chiapas, while Nima-Kiche obtained the country of the Kiches,
Kakchiquels, and Tzutuhils. It would be extremely difficult to say
whether or not this tradition rests on any veritable historical basis.
If so, it refers to a period anterior to the Nahua irruption, for the
districts alluded to as occupied by these tribes were not so divided
among them at the coming of the Spaniards.</p>

Indeed, a period of such uncertainty occurs that even the number of
kings who reigned is lost in the hopeless confusion of varying
estimates. From this chaos emerge the facts that the Kiche monarchs
held the supreme power among the peoples of Guatemala, that they were
the contemporaries of the rulers of Mexico city, and that they were
often elected from among the princes of the subject states. Acxopil,
the successor of Nima-Kiche, invested his second son with the
government of the Kakchiquels, and placed his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=

eldest son he left the throne of the Kiches. Icutemal, his eldest son,
on succeeding his father, gifted the kingdom of Kakchiquel to his
eldest son, displacing his own brother and thus mortally affronting
him. The struggle which ensued lasted for generations, embittered the
relations between these two branches of the Maya in Guatemala, and
undermined their joint strength. Nahua mercenaries were employed in the
struggle on both sides, and these introduced many of the uglinesses of
Nahua life into Maya existence.</p>

Maya history are, alas! sealed to us at present. We allude to the
native Maya manuscripts and inscriptions, the writing of which cannot
be deciphered by present-day scholars. Some of the old Spanish friars
who lived in the times which directly succeeded the settlement of the
country by the white man were able to read and <span class=

to write this script, but unfortunately they regarded it either as an
invention of the Father of Evil or, as it was a native system, as a
thing of no value. In a few generations all knowledge of how to
decipher it was totally lost, and it remains to the modern world almost
as a sealed book, although science has lavished all its wonderful
machinery of logic and deduction upon it, and men of unquestioned
ability have dedicated their lives to the problem of unravelling what
must be regarded as one of the greatest and most mysterious riddles of
which mankind ever attempted the solution.</p>

hieroglyphic system of writing is well known. For centuries the symbols
displayed upon the temples and monuments of the Nile country were so
many meaningless pictures and signs to the learned folk of Europe,
until the discovery of the Rosetta stone a hundred years ago made their
elucidation possible. This stone bore the same inscription in Greek,
demotic, and hieroglyphics, and so the discovery of the
&ldquo;alphabet&rdquo; of the hidden script became a comparatively easy
task. But Central America has no Rosetta stone, nor is it possible that
such an aid to research can ever be found. Indeed, such
&ldquo;keys&rdquo; as have been discovered or brought forward by

and Madrid. These are known as the Codex Perezianus, preserved in the
<span lang="fr">Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale</span> at Paris, the
Dresden Codex, long regarded as an Aztec manuscript, and the Troano
Codex, so called from one of its owners, Se&ntilde;or Tro y Ortolano,
found at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>Madrid in 1865. These manuscripts deal
principally with Maya mythology, but as they cannot be deciphered with
any degree of accuracy they do not greatly assist our knowledge of the
subject.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The System of the Writing</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The &ldquo;Tablet of the Cross&rdquo; gives a good
idea of the general appearance of the writing system of the ancient
peoples of Central America. The style varies somewhat in most of the
manuscripts and inscriptions, but it is generally admitted that all of
the systems employed sprang originally from one common source. The
square figures which appear as a tangle of faces and objects are said
to be &ldquo;calculiform,&rdquo; or pebble-shaped, a not inappropriate
description, and it is known from ancient Spanish manuscripts that they
were read from top to bottom, and two columns at a time. The Maya
tongue, like all native American languages, was one which, in order to
express an idea, gathered a whole phrase into a single word, and it has
been thought that the several symbols or parts in each square or sketch
go to make up such a compound expression.</p>
<p class="par">The first key (so called) to the hieroglyphs of Central
America was that of Bishop Landa, who about 1575 attempted to set down
the Maya alphabet from native sources. He was highly unpopular with the
natives, whose literary treasures he had almost completely destroyed,
and who in revenge deliberately misled him as to the true significance
of the various symbols.</p>
<p class="par">The first real step toward reading the Maya writing was
made in 1876 by L&eacute;on de Rosny, a French student of American
antiquities, who succeeded in interpreting the signs which denote the
four cardinal points. As has been the case in so many discoveries of
importance, the significance of these signs was simultaneously
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>discovered by Professor Cyrus Thomas in America.
In two of these four signs was found the symbol which meant
&ldquo;sun,&rdquo; almost, as de Rosny acknowledged, as a matter of
course. However, the Maya word for &ldquo;sun&rdquo; (kin) also denotes
&ldquo;day,&rdquo; and it was later proved that this sign was also used
with the latter meaning. The discovery of the sign stimulated further
research to a great degree, and from the material now at their disposal
Drs. F&ouml;rstemann and Schellhas of Berlin were successful in
discovering the sign for the moon and that for the Maya month of twenty
days.</p>

<h3 class="main">Clever Elucidations</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In 1887 Dr. Seler discovered the sign for night
(<i>akbal</i>), and in 1894 F&ouml;rstemann unriddled the symbols for
&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; and &ldquo;end.&rdquo; These are two heads, the
first of which has the sign <i>akbal</i>, just mentioned, for an eye.
Now <i>akbal</i> means, as well as &ldquo;night,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
beginning of the month,&rdquo; and below the face which contains it can
be seen footsteps, or spots which resemble their outline, signifying a
forward movement. The sign in the second head means
&ldquo;seventh,&rdquo; which in Maya also signifies &ldquo;the
end.&rdquo; From the frequent contrast of these terms there can be
little doubt that their meaning is as stated.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Union&rdquo; is denoted by the sting of a
rattlesnake, the coils of that reptile signifying to the Maya the idea
of tying together. In contrast to this sign is the figure next to it,
which represents a knife, and means &ldquo;division&rdquo; or
&ldquo;cutting.&rdquo; An important &ldquo;letter&rdquo; is the hand,
which often occurs in both manuscripts and inscriptions. It is drawn
sometimes in the act of grasping, with the thumb bent forward, and
sometimes as pointing in a certain direction. The first seems to denote
a tying together or joining, like the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>rattlesnake symbol,
and the second F&ouml;rstemann believes to represent a lapse of time.
That it may represent futurity occurs as a more likely conjecture to
the present writer.</p>
<p class="par">The figure denoting the spring equinox was traced
because of its obvious representation of a cloud from which three
streams of water are falling upon the earth. The square at the top
represents heaven. The obsidian knife underneath denotes a division or
period of time cut off, as it were, from other periods of the year.
That the sign means &ldquo;spring&rdquo; is verified by its position
among the other signs of the seasons.</p>
<p class="par">The sign for &ldquo;week&rdquo; was discovered by reason
of its almost constant accompaniment of the sign for the number
thirteen, the number of days in the Maya sacred week. The symbol of the
bird&rsquo;s feather indicates the plural, and when affixed to certain
signs signifies that the object indicated is multiplied. A bird&rsquo;s
feather, when one thinks of it, is one of the most fitting symbols
provided by nature to designate the plural, if the number of shoots on
both sides of the stem are taken as meaning &ldquo;many&rdquo; or
&ldquo;two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Water is depicted by the figure of a serpent, which
reptile typifies the undulating nature of the element. The sign
entitled &ldquo;the sacrificial victim&rdquo; is of deep human
interest. The first portion of the symbol is the death-bird, and the
second shows a crouching and beaten captive, ready to be immolated to
one of the terrible Maya deities whose sanguinary religion demanded
human sacrifice. The drawing which means &ldquo;the day of the new
year,&rdquo; in the month Ceh, was unriddled by the following means:
The sign in the upper left-hand corner denotes the word
&ldquo;sun&rdquo; or &ldquo;day,&rdquo; that in the upper right-hand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>corner is the sign for &ldquo;year.&rdquo; In
the lower right-hand corner is the sign for &ldquo;division,&rdquo; and
in the lower left-hand the sign for the Maya month Ceh, already known
from the native calendars.</p>
<p class="par">From its accompaniment of a figure known to be a deity
of the four cardinal points, whence all American tribes believed the
wind to come, the symbol entitled &ldquo;wind&rdquo; has been
determined.</p>

<h3 class="main">Methods of Study</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The method employed by those engaged in the
elucidation of these hieroglyphs is typical of modern science. The
various signs and symbols are literally &ldquo;worn out&rdquo; by a
process of indefatigable examination. For hours the student sits
staring at a symbol, drinking in every detail, however infinitesimal,
until the drawing and all its parts are wholly and separately
photographed upon the tablets of his memory. He then compares the
several portions of the symbol with similar portions in other signs the
value of which is known. From these he may obtain a clue to the meaning
of the whole. Thus proceeding from the known to the unknown, he
advances logically toward a complete elucidation of all the hieroglyphs
depicted in the various manuscripts and inscriptions.</p>
<p class="par">The method by which Dr. Seler discovered the hieroglyphs
or symbols relating to the various gods of the Maya was both simple and
ingenious. He says: &ldquo;The way in which this was accomplished is
strikingly simple. It amounts essentially to that which in ordinary
life we call &lsquo;memory of persons,&rsquo; and follows almost
naturally from a careful study of the manuscripts. For, by frequently
looking tentatively at the representations, one learns by degrees to
recognise promptly similar and familiar figures of gods by the
characteristic impression <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=

details, and the same is true of the accompanying
hieroglyphs.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Maya Numeral System</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">If Bishop Landa was badly hoaxed regarding the
alphabet of the Maya, he was successful in discovering and handing down
their numeral system, which was on a very much higher basis than that
of many civilised peoples, being, for example, more practical and more
fully evolved than that of ancient Rome. This system employed four
signs altogether, the point for unity, a horizontal stroke for the
number 5, and two signs for 20 and 0. Yet from these simple elements
the Maya produced a method of computation which is perhaps as ingenious
as anything which has ever been accomplished in the history of
mathematics. In the Maya arithmetical system, as in ours, it is the
position of the sign that gives it its value. The figures were placed
in a vertical line, and one of them was employed as a decimal
multiplier. The lowest figure of the column had the arithmetical value
which it represented. The figures which appeared in the second, fourth,
and each following place had twenty times the value of the preceding
figures, while figures in the third place had eighteen times the value
of those in the second place. This system admits of computation up to
millions, and is one of the surest signs of Maya culture.</p>
<p class="par">Much controversy has raged round the exact nature of the
Maya hieroglyphs. Were they understood by the Indians themselves as
representing ideas or merely pictures, or did they convey a given sound
to the reader, as does our alphabet? To some extent controversy upon
the point is futile, as those of the Spanish clergy who were able to
learn the writing from the native Maya have confirmed its phonetic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>character, so that in reality each symbol must
have conveyed a sound or sounds to the reader, not merely an idea or a
picture. Recent research has amply proved this, so that the full
elucidation of the long and painful puzzle on which so much learning
and patience have been lavished may perhaps be at hand.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Maya pantheon, although it bears a strong
resemblance to that of the Nahua, differs from it in so many respects
that it is easy to observe that at one period it must have been
absolutely free from all Nahua influence. We may, then, provisionally
accept the theory that at some relatively distant period the
mythologies of the Nahua and Maya were influenced from one common
centre, if they were not originally identical, but that later the
inclusion in the cognate but divided systems of local deities and the
superimposition of the deities and rites of immigrant peoples had
caused such differentiation as to render somewhat vague the original
likeness between them. In the Mexican mythology we have as a key-note
the custom of human sacrifice. It has often been stated as exhibiting
the superior status in civilisation of the Maya that their religion was
free from the revolting practices which characterised the Nahua faith.
This, however, is totally erroneous. Although the Maya were not nearly
so prone to the practice of human sacrifice as were the Nahua, they
frequently engaged in it, and the pictures which have been drawn of
their bloodless offerings must not lead us to believe that they never
indulged in this rite. It is known, for example, that they sacrificed
maidens to the water-god at the period of the spring florescence, by
casting them into a deep pool, where they were drowned. <span class=

Mexico that Quetzalcoatl was a god foreign to the soil; or at least
relatively aboriginal to his rival Tezcatlipoca, if not to the Nahua
themselves. It is amusing to see it stated by authorities of the
highest standing that his worship was free from bloodshed. But it does
not appear whether the sanguinary rites connected with the name of
Quetzalcoatl in Mexico were undertaken by his priests of their own
accord or at the instigation and pressure of the pontiff of
Huitzilopochtli, under whose jurisdiction they were. The designation by
which Quetzalcoatl was known to the Maya was Kukulcan, which signifies
&ldquo;Feathered Serpent,&rdquo; and is exactly translated by his
Mexican name. In Guatemala he was called Gucumatz, which word is also
identical in Kiche with his other native appellations. But the Kukulcan
of the Maya appears to be dissimilar from Quetzalcoatl in several of
his attributes. The difference in climate would probably account for
most of these. In Mexico Quetzalcoatl, as we have seen, was not only
the Man of the Sun, but the original wind-god of the country. The
Kukulcan of the Maya has more the attributes of a thunder-god. In the
tropical climate of Yucatan and Guatemala the sun at midday appears to
draw the clouds around it in serpentine shapes. From these emanate
thunder and lightning and the fertilising rain, so that Kukulcan would
appear to have appealed to the Maya more as a god of the sky who
wielded the thunderbolts than a god of the atmosphere proper like
Quetzalcoatl, though several of the stel&aelig; in Yucatan represent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=

<p class="par first">The principal sources of our knowledge of the Maya
deities are the Dresden, Madrid, and Paris codices alluded to
previously, all of which contain many pictorial representations of the
various members of the Maya pantheon. Of the very names of some of
these gods we are so ignorant, and so difficult is the process of
affixing to them the traditional names which are left to us as those of
the Maya gods, that Dr. Paul Schellhas, a German student of Maya
antiquities, has proposed that the figures of deities appearing in the
Maya codices or manuscripts should be provisionally indicated by the
letters of the alphabet. The figures of gods which thus occur are
fifteen in number, and therefore take the letters of the alphabet from
A to P, the letter J being omitted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Unluckily the accounts of Spanish authors
concerning Maya mythology do not agree with the representations of the
gods delineated in the codices. That the three codices have a mythology
in common is certain. Again, great difficulty is found in comparing the
deities of the codices with those represented by the carved and stucco
bas-reliefs of the Maya region. It will thus be seen that very
considerable difficulties beset the student in this mythological
sphere. So few data have yet been collected regarding the Maya
mythology that to dogmatise upon any subject connected with it would
indeed be rash. But much has been accomplished in the past few decades,
and evidence is slowly but surely accumulating from which sound
conclusions can be drawn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=

<p class="par first">We witness in the Maya mythology a dualism almost
as complete as that of ancient Persia&mdash;the conflict between light
and darkness. Opposing each other we behold on the one hand the deities
of the sun, the gods of warmth and light, of civilisation and the joy
of life, and on the other the deities of darksome death, of night,
gloom, and fear. From these primal conceptions of light and darkness
all the mythologic forms of the Maya are evolved. When we catch the
first recorded glimpses of Maya belief we recognise that at the period
when it came under the purview of Europeans the gods of darkness were
in the ascendant and a deep pessimism had spread over Maya thought and
theology. Its joyful side was subordinated to the worship of gloomy
beings, the deities of death and hell, and if the cult of light was
attended with such touching fidelity it was because the benign agencies
who were worshipped in connection with it had promised not to desert
mankind altogether, but to return at some future indefinite period and
resume their sway of radiance and peace.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Like that of the Nahua, the Maya mythology was
based almost entirely upon the calendar, which in its astronomic
significance and duration was identical with that of the Mexicans. The
ritual year of twenty &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; of thirteen days each was
divided into four quarters, each of these being under the auspices of a
different quarter of the heavens. Each &ldquo;week&rdquo; was under the
supervision of a particular deity, as will be seen when we come to deal
separately with the various gods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"

<h3 class="main">Traditional Knowledge of the Gods</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The heavenly bodies had important representation
in the Maya pantheon. In Yucatan the sun-god was known as Kinich-ahau
(Lord of the Face of the Sun). He was identified with the Fire-bird, or
Arara, and was thus called Kinich-Kakmo (Fire-bird; lit. Sun-bird). He
was also the presiding genius of the north.</p>
<p class="par">Itzamna, one of the most important of the Maya deities,
was a moon-god, the father of gods and men. In him was typified the
decay and recurrence of life in nature. His name was derived from the
words he was supposed to have given to men regarding himself:
&ldquo;Itz en caan, itz en muyal&rdquo; (&ldquo;I am the dew of the
heaven, I am the dew of the clouds&rdquo;). He was tutelar deity of the
west.</p>
<p class="par">Chac, the rain-god, is the possessor of an elongated
nose, not unlike the proboscis of a tapir, which of course is the spout
whence comes the rain which he blows over the earth. He is one of the
best represented gods on both manuscripts and monuments, and presides
over the east. The black god Ekchuah was the god of merchants and
cacao-planters. He is represented in the manuscripts several times.</p>
<p class="par">Ix ch&rsquo;el was the goddess of medicine, and Ix
chebel yax was identified by the priest Hernandez with the Virgin Mary.
There were also several deities, or rather genii, called Bacabs, who
were the upholders of the heavens in the four quarters of the sky. The
names of these were Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac, representing the east,
north, west, and south. Their symbolic colours were yellow, white,
black, and red respectively. They corresponded in some degree to the
four variants of the Mexican rain-god Tlaloc, for many of the American
races believed that rain, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171"
href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>fertiliser of the soil,
emanated from the four points of the compass. We shall find still other
deities when we come to discuss the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, the saga-book of
the Kiche, but it is difficult to say how far these were connected with
the deities of the Maya of Yucatan, concerning whom we have little
traditional knowledge, and it is better to deal with them separately,
pointing out resemblances where these appear to exist.</p>

<h3 class="main">Maya Polytheism</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the whole the Maya do not seem to have been
burdened with an extensive pantheon, as were the Nahua, and their
polytheism appears to have been of a limited character. Although they
possessed a number of divinities, these were in a great measure only
different forms of one and the same divine power&mdash;probably
localised forms of it. The various Maya tribes worshipped similar gods
under different names. They recognised divine unity in the god Hunabku,
who was invisible and supreme, but he does not bulk largely in their
mythology, any more than does the universal All-Father in other early
faiths. The sun is the great deity in Maya religion, and the myths
which tell of the origin of the Maya people are purely solar. As the
sun comes from the east, so the hero-gods who bring with them culture
and enlightenment have an oriental origin. As Votan, as Kabil, the
&ldquo;Red Hand&rdquo; who initiates the people into the arts of
writing and architecture, these gods are civilising men of the sun as
surely as is Quetzalcoatl.</p>

chronicler, &ldquo;have an immoderate fear of death, and they seem to
have given it a figure peculiarly repulsive.&rdquo; We shall find this
deity alluded to in the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, under the name Camazotz, in
close proximity to the Lords of Death and Hell, attempting to bar the
journey of the hero-gods across these dreary realms. He is frequently
met with on the Copan reliefs, and a Maya clan, the Ah-zotzils, were
called by his name. They were of Kakchiquel origin, and he was probably
their totem.</p>

research has done to elucidate the character of the various Maya
deities. We have already seen that they have been provisionally named
by the letters of the alphabet until such proof is forthcoming as will
identify them with the traditional gods of the Maya, and we will now
briefly examine what is known concerning them under their temporary
designations.</p>

<div id="xd22e3167" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">God A</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the Dresden and other codices god A is
represented as a figure with exposed vertebr&aelig; and skull-like
countenance, with the marks of corruption on his body, and displaying
every sign of mortality. On his head he wears a snail-symbol, the Aztec
sign of birth, perhaps to typify the connection between birth and
death. He also wears a pair of cross-bones. The hieroglyph which
accompanies his figure represents a corpse&rsquo;s head with closed
eyes, a skull, and a sacrificial knife. His symbol is that for the
calendar day Cimi, which means death. He presides over the west, the
home of the dead, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>region toward which they
invariably depart with the setting sun. That he is a death-god there
can be no doubt, but of his name we are ignorant. He is probably
identical with the Aztec god of death and hell, Mictlan, and is perhaps
one of those Lords of Death and Hell who invite the heroes to the
celebrated game of ball in the Kiche <i>Popol Vuh</i>, and hold them
prisoners in their gloomy realm.</p>
<p class="par">God B is the deity who appears most frequently in the
manuscripts. He has a long, truncated nose, like that of a tapir, and
we find in him every sign of a god of the elements. He walks the
waters, wields fiery torches, and seats himself on the cruciform tree
of the four winds which appears so frequently in American myth. He is
evidently a culture-god or hero, as he is seen planting maize, carrying
tools, and going on a journey, a fact which establishes his solar
connection. He is, in fact, Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, and on examining
him we feel that at least there can be no doubt concerning his
identity.</p>
<p class="par">Concerning god C matter is lacking, but he is evidently
a god of the pole-star, as in one of the codices he is surrounded by
planetary signs and wears a nimbus of rays.</p>
<p class="par">God D is almost certainly a moon-god. He is represented
as an aged man, with sunken cheeks and wrinkled forehead on which hangs
the sign for night. His hieroglyph is surrounded by dots, to represent
a starry sky, and is followed by the number 20, to show the duration of
the moon. Like most moon deities he is connected with birth, for
occasionally he wears the snail, symbol of parturition, on his head. It
is probable that he is Itzamna, one of the greatest of Maya gods, who
was regarded as the universal life-giver, and was probably of very
ancient origin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"

<p class="par first">God E is another deity whom we have no difficulty
in identifying. He wears the leafed ear of maize as his head-dress. In
fact, his head has been evolved out of the conventional drawings of the
ear of maize, so we may say at once without any difficulty that he is a
maize-god pure and simple, and a parallel with the Aztec maize-god
Centeotl. Brinton calls this god Ghanan, and Schellhas thinks he may be
identical with a deity Yum Kaax, whose name means &ldquo;Lord of the
Harvest Fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A close resemblance can be noticed between gods F and A,
and it is thought that the latter resembles the Aztec Xipe, the god of
human sacrifice. He is adorned with the same black lines running over
the face and body, typifying gaping death-wounds.</p>

<p class="par first">In G we may be sure that we have found a sun-god
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. His hieroglyph is the sun-sign,
<i>kin</i>. But we must be careful not to confound him with deities
like Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. He is, like the Mexican Totec, the sun
itself, and not the Man of the Sun, the civilising agent, who leaves
his bright abode to dwell with man and introduce him to the arts of
cultured existence. He is the luminary himself, whose only acceptable
food is human blood, and who must be fed full with this terrible fare
or perish, dragging the world of men with him into a fathomless abyss
of gloom. We need not be surprised, therefore, to see god G
occasionally wearing the symbols of death.</p>
<p class="par">God H would seem to have some relationship to the
serpent, but what it may be is obscure, and no certain identification
can be made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=

<p class="par">I is a water-goddess, an old woman with wrinkled brown
body and claw-like feet, wearing on her head a grisly snake twisted
into a knot, to typify the serpent-like nature of water. She holds in
her hands an earthenware pot from which water flows. We cannot say that
she resembles the Mexican water-goddess, Chalchihuitlicue, wife of
Tlaloc, who was in most respects a deity of a beneficent character. I
seems a personification of water in its more dreadful aspect of floods
and water-spouts, as it must inevitably have appeared to the people of
the more torrid regions of Central America, and that she was regarded
as an agent of death is shown from her occasionally wearing the
cross-bones of the death-god.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">God K is scientifically known as &ldquo;the god
with the ornamented nose,&rdquo; and is probably closely related to god
B. Concerning him no two authorities are at one, some regarding him as
a storm-god, whose proboscis, like that of Kukulcan, is intended to
represent the blast of the tempest. But we observe certain stellar
signs in connection with K which would go to prove that he is, indeed,
one of the Quetzalcoatl group. His features are constantly to be met
with on the gateways and corners of the ruined shrines of Central
America, and have led many &ldquo;antiquarians&rdquo; to believe in the
existence of an elephant-headed god, whereas his trunk-like snout is
merely a funnel through which he emitted the gales over which he had
dominion, as a careful study of the <i>pinturas</i> shows, the wind
being depicted issuing from the snout in question. At the same time,
the snout may have been modelled on that of the tapir. &ldquo;If the
rain-god Chac is distinguished in the Maya manuscript by a peculiarly
long nose curving over the mouth, and if in the other forms of the
rain-god, to which, as it seems, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>name of Balon Zacab
belongs, the nose widens out and sends out shoots, I believe that the
tapir which was employed identically with Chac, the Maya rain-god,
furnished the model,&rdquo; says Dr. Seler. Is K, then, the same as
Chac? Chac bears every sign of affinity with the Mexican rain-god
Tlaloc, whose face was evolved from the coils of two snakes, and also
some resemblance to the snouted features of B and K. But, again, the
Mexican pictures of Quetzalcoatl are not at all like those of Tlaloc,
so that there can be no affinity between Tlaloc and K. Therefore if the
Mexican Tlaloc and the Maya Chac be identical, and Tlaloc differs from
Quetzalcoatl, who in turn is identical with B and K, it is clear that
Chac has nothing to do with K.</p>

lower, part of his features being covered with black paint. He is
represented in the Dresden MS. only. Professor Cyrus Thomas, of New
York, thinks that he is the god Ekchuah, who is traditionally described
as black, but Schellhas fits this designation to god M. The more
probable theory is that of F&ouml;rstemann, who sees in L the god
Votan, who is identical with the Aztec earth-god, Tepeyollotl. Both
deities have similar face markings, and their dark hue is perhaps
symbolical of the subterranean places where they were supposed to

it developed without outside aid that the Maya people most individually
expressed itself. As has been said, those buildings which still remain,
and which have excited the admiration of generations of
arch&aelig;ologists, are principally confined to examples of
ecclesiastical and governmental architecture, the dwellings of the
common people consisting merely of the flimsiest of wattle-and-daub
structures, which would fall to pieces shortly after they were
abandoned.</p>
<p class="par">Buried in dense forests or mouldering on the sun-exposed
plains of Yucatan, Honduras, and Guatemala, the cities which boasted
these edifices are for the most part situated away from modern trade
routes, and are not a little difficult to come at. It is in Yucatan,
the old home of the Cocomes and Tutul Xius, that the most perfect
specimens of Maya architecture are to be found, especially as regards
its later development, and here, too, it may be witnessed in its
decadent phase.</p>

<h3 class="main">Methods of Building</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Maya buildings were almost always erected upon
a mound or <i>ku</i>, either natural or artificial, generally the
latter. In this we discover affinities with the Mexican <i>teocalli</i>
type. Often these <i>kus</i> stood alone, without any superincumbent
building save a small altar to prove their relation to the temple type
of Anahuac. The typical Maya temple was built on a series of earth
terraces arranged in exact parallel order, the buildings themselves
forming the sides of a square. The mounds are generally concealed by
plaster or faced with stone, the variety employed being usually a hard
sandstone, of which the Maya had a good supply in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>the
quarries of Chiapas and Honduras. Moderate in weight, the difficulty of
transport was easily overcome, whilst large blocks could be readily
quarried. It will thus be seen that the Maya had no substantial
difficulties to surmount in connection with building the large edifices
and temples they raised, except, perhaps, the lack of metal tools to
shape and carve and quarry the stone which they used. And although they
exhibit considerable ingenuity in such architectural methods as they
employed, they were still surprisingly ignorant of some of the first
essentials and principles of the art.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">For example, they were totally ignorant of the
principles upon which the arch is constructed. This difficulty they
overcame by making each course of masonry overhang the one beneath it,
after the method employed by a boy with a box of bricks, who finds that
he can only make &ldquo;doorways&rdquo; by this means, or by the simple
expedient&mdash;also employed by the Maya&mdash;of placing a slab
horizontally upon two upright pillars. In consequence it will readily
be seen that the superimposition of a second story upon such an
insecure foundation was scarcely to be thought of, and that such
support for the roof as towered above the doorway would necessarily
require to be of the most substantial description. Indeed, this portion
of the building often appears to be more than half the size of the rest
of the edifice. This space gave the Maya builders a splendid chance for
mural decoration, and it must be said they readily seized it and made
the most of it, ornamental fa&ccedil;ades being perhaps the most
typical features in the relics of Maya architecture. <span class=

<p class="par first">But the Maya possessed another type of building
which permitted of their raising more than one story. This was the
pyramidal type, of which many examples remain. The first story was
built in the usual manner, and the second was raised by increasing the
height of the mound at the back of the building until it was upon a
level with the roof&mdash;another device well known to the boy with the
box of bricks. In the centre of the space thus made another story could
be erected, which was entered by a staircase outside the building.
Hampered by their inability to build to any appreciable height, the
Maya architects made up for the deficiency by constructing edifices of
considerable length and breadth, the squat appearance of which is
counterbalanced by the beautiful mural decoration of the sides and
fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">He would be a merely superficial observer who
would form the conclusion that these specimens of an architecture
spontaneously evolved were put together without survey, design, or
previous calculation. That as much thought entered into their
construction as is lavished upon his work by a modern architect is
proved by the manner in which the carved stones fit into one another.
It would be absurd to suppose that these tremendous fa&ccedil;ades
bristling with scores of intricate designs could have been first placed
in position and subsequently laden with the bas-reliefs they exhibit.
It is plain that they were previously worked apart and separately from
one entire design. Thus we see that the highest capabilities of the
architect were essential in a measure to the erection of these imposing
structures. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Although the mason-craft of the Maya peoples was
essentially similar in all the regions populated by its various tribes
and offshoots, there existed in the several localities occupied by them
certain differences in construction and ornamentation which would
almost justify us in dividing them into separate architectural spheres.
In Chiapas, for example, we find the bas-relief predominant, whether in
stone or stucco. In Honduras we find a stiffness of design which
implies an older type of architecture, along with caryatides and
memorial pillars of human shape. In Guatemala, again, we find traces of
the employment of wood. As the civilisation of the Maya cannot be well
comprehended without some knowledge of their architecture, and as that
art was unquestionably their national <i>forte</i> and the thing which
most sharply distinguished them from the semi-savage peoples that
surrounded them, it will be well to consider it for a space as regards
its better-known individual examples.</p>

without experiencing some thrill from the mystery which surrounds it.
Although familiarised with the study of the Maya antiquities by reason
of many years of close acquaintance with it, the author cannot approach
the theme without a feeling of the most intense awe. We are considering
the memorials of a race isolated for countless thousands of years from
the rest of humanity&mdash;a race which by itself evolved a
civilisation in every respect capable of comparison with those of
ancient Egypt or Assyria. In these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>impenetrable forests and
sun-baked plains mighty works were raised which tell of a culture of a
lofty type. We are aware that the people who reared them entered into
religious and perhaps philosophical considerations their
interpretations of which place them upon a level with the most
enlightened races of antiquity; but we have only stepped upon the
margin of Maya history. What dread secrets, what scenes of orgic
splendour have those carven walls witnessed? What solemn priestly
conclave, what magnificence of rite, what marvels of initiation, have
these forest temples known? These things we shall never learn. They are
hidden from us in a gloom as palpable as that of the tree-encircled
depths in which we find these shattered works of a once powerful
hierarchy.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mysterious Palenque</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the most famous of these ancient centres of
priestly domination is Palenque, situated in the modern state of
Chiapas. This city was first brought into notice by Don Jos&eacute;
Calderon in 1774, when he discovered no less than eighteen palaces,
twenty great buildings, and a hundred and sixty houses, which proves
that in his day the primeval forest had not made such inroads upon the
remaining buildings as it has during the past few generations. There is
good evidence besides this that Palenque was standing at the time of
Cort&eacute;s&rsquo; conquest of Yucatan. And here it will be well at
once to dispel any conception the reader may have formed concerning the
vast antiquity of these cities and the structures they contain. The
very oldest of them cannot be of a date anterior to the thirteenth
century, and few Americanists of repute would admit such an antiquity
for them. There may be remains of a fragmentary nature here and there
in Central America which are relatively more ancient. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>But
no temple or edifice which remains standing can claim a greater
antiquity.</p>
<p class="par">Palenque is built in the form of an amphitheatre, and
nestles on the lowest slopes of the Cordilleras. Standing on the
central pyramid, the eye is met by a ring of ruined palaces and temples
raised upon artificial terraces. Of these the principal and most
imposing is the Palace, a pile reared upon a single platform, forming
an irregular quadrilateral, with a double gallery on the east, north,
and west sides, surrounding an inner structure with a similar gallery
and two courtyards. It is evident that there was little system or plan
observed in the construction of this edifice, an unusual circumstance
in Maya architecture. The dwelling apartments were situated on the
southern side of the structure, and here there is absolute confusion,
for buildings of all sorts and sizes jostle each other, and are reared
on different levels.</p>
<p class="par">Our interest is perhaps at first excited by three
subterraneous apartments down a flight of gloomy steps. Here are to be
found three great stone tables, the edges of which are fretted with
sculptured symbols. That these were altars admits of little doubt,
although some visitors have not hesitated to call them dining-tables!
These constitute only one of the many puzzles in this building of 228
feet frontage, with a depth of 180 feet, which at the same time is only
about 25 feet high!</p>
<p class="par">On the north side of the Palace pyramid the
fa&ccedil;ade of the Palace has crumbled into complete ruin, but some
evidences of an entrance are still noticeable. There were probably
fourteen doorways in all in the frontage, with a width of about 9 feet
each, the piers of which were covered with figures in bas-relief. The
inside of the galleries is also covered at intervals with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>similar designs, or medallions, many of which
are probably representations of priests or priestesses who once dwelt
within the classic shades and practised strange rites in the worship of
gods long since forgotten. One of these is of a woman with delicate
features and high-bred countenance, and the frame or rim surrounding it
is decorated in a manner recalling the Louis XV style.</p>
<p class="par">The east gallery is 114 feet long, the north 185 feet,
and the west 102 feet, so that, as remarked above, a lack of symmetry
is apparent. The great court is reached by a Mayan arch which leads on
to a staircase, on each side of which grotesque human figures of the
Maya type are sculptured. Whom they are intended to portray or what
rite they are engaged in it would indeed be difficult to say. That they
are priests may be hazarded, for they appear to be dressed in the
ecclesiastical <i>maxtli</i> (girdle), and one seems to be decorated
with the beads seen in the pictures of the death-god. Moreover, they
are mitred.</p>
<p class="par">The courtyard is exceedingly irregular in shape. To the
south side is a small building which has assisted our knowledge of Maya
mural decoration; especially valuable is the handsome frieze with which
it is adorned, on which we observe the rather familiar feathered
serpent (Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl). Everywhere we notice the flat Maya
head&mdash;a racial type, perhaps brought about by deformation of the
cranium in youth. One of the most important parts of the Palace from an
architectural point of view is the east front of the inner wing, which
is perhaps the best preserved, and exhibits the most luxurious
ornamentation. Two roofed galleries supported by six pillars covered
with bas-reliefs are reached by a staircase on which hieroglyphic signs
still remain. The reliefs in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>cement are still faintly to be
discerned on the pillars, and must have been of great beauty. They
represent mythological characters in various attitudes. Above, seven
enormous heads frown on the explorer in grim menace. The effect of the
entire fa&ccedil;ade is rich in the extreme, even in ruin, and from it
we can obtain a faint idea of the splendours of this wonderful
civilisation.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the few towers to be seen among the ruins
of Maya architecture stands at Palenque. It is square in shape and
three stories in height, with sloping roof, and is not unlike the
belfry of some little English village church.</p>
<p class="par">The building we have been describing, although
traditionally known as a &ldquo;palace,&rdquo; was undoubtedly a great
monastery or ecclesiastical habitation. Indeed, the entire city of
Palenque was solely a priestly centre, a place of pilgrimage. The
bas-reliefs with their representations of priests and acolytes prove
this, as does the absence of warlike or monarchical subjects.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Temple of Inscriptions</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Temple of Inscriptions, perched on an eminence
some 40 feet high, is the largest edifice in Palenque. It has a
fa&ccedil;ade 74 feet long by 25 feet deep, composed of a great gallery
which runs along the entire front of the fane. The building has been
named from the inscriptions with which certain flagstones in the
central apartment are covered. Three other temples occupy a piece of
rising ground close by. These are the Temple of the Sun, closely akin
in type to many Japanese temple buildings; the Temple of the Cross, in
which a wonderful altar-piece was discovered; and the Temple of the
Cross No. II. In the Temple of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>Cross the inscribed altar
gave its name to the building. In the central slab is a cross of the
American pattern, its roots springing from the hideous head of the
goddess Chicomecohuatl, the Earth-mother, or her Maya equivalent. Its
branches stretch to where on the right and left stand two figures,
evidently those of a priest and acolyte, performing some mysterious
rite. On the apex of the tree is placed the sacred turkey, or
&ldquo;Emerald Fowl,&rdquo; to which offerings of maize paste are made.
The whole is surrounded by inscriptions. (See illustration facing p.

base of which covers an area of nearly 650 square feet. To this shrine
thousands were wont to come in times of panic or famine, and from the
summit, where was housed the glittering idol, the smoke of sacrifice
ascended to the cloudless sky, whilst a multitude of white-robed
priests and augurs chanted and prophesied. To the south of this mighty
pile stand the ruins of the Ppapp-Hol-Chac (The House of Heads and

Miraculous Hand), as they designated the deity. The fourth road ran to
the sacred isle of Cozumel, where first the men of Spain found the Maya
cross, and supposed it to prove that St. Thomas had discovered the
American continent in early times, and had converted the natives to a
Christianity which had become debased.</p>

allusion, probably, to the god of lightning, Hurakan, whose gigantic
face, once dominating the basement wall, has now disappeared. This face
possessed huge mustachios, appendages unknown to the Maya race; and,
indeed, we are struck with the frequency with which Mexican and Mayan
gods and heroes are adorned with beards and other hirsute ornaments
both on the monuments and in the manuscripts. Was the original
governing class a bearded race? It is scarcely probable. Whence, then,
the ever-recurring beard and moustache? These may have been developed
in the priestly class by constant ceremonial shaving, which often
produces a thin beard in the Mongolians&mdash;as witness the modern
Japanese, who in imitating a custom of the West often succeed in
producing quite respectable beards.</p>

steep flight of steps, and from it the vast <span class=

To the east is the market-place, to the north a mighty temple, and a
tennis-court, perhaps the best example of its kind in Yucatan, whilst
to the west stand the Nunnery and the Chichan-Chob, or prison.
Concerning Chichen-Itza Cogolludo tells the following story: &ldquo;A
king of Chichen called Canek fell desperately in love with a young
princess, who, whether she did not return his affection or whether she
was compelled to obey a parental mandate, married a more powerful
Yucatec <i>cacique</i>. The discarded lover, unable to bear his loss,
and moved by love and despair, armed his dependents and suddenly fell
upon his successful rival. Then the gaiety of the feast was exchanged
for the din of war, and amidst the confusion the Chichen prince
disappeared, carrying off the beautiful bride. But conscious that his
power was less than his rival&rsquo;s, and fearing his vengeance, he
fled the country with most of his vassals.&rdquo; It is a historical
fact that the inhabitants of Chichen abandoned their city, but whether
for the reason given in this story or not cannot be discovered.</p>

beauty of outline and decoration, the frieze above the doorway and the
fretted ornamentation of the upper story exciting the admiration of
most writers on the subject. Here dwelt the sacred women, the chief of
whom, like their male prototypes, were dedicated to Kukulcan and
regarded with much reverence. The base of the building is occupied by
eight large figures, and over the door is the representation of a
priest with a <i>panache</i>, whilst a row of gigantic heads crowns the
north fa&ccedil;ade. Here, too, are figures of the wind-god,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=

antiquarians took for heads of elephants with waving trunks! The entire
building is one of the gems of Central American architecture, and
delights the eye of arch&aelig;ologist and artist alike. In El Castillo
are found wonderful bas-reliefs depicting bearded men, evidently the
priests of Quetzalcoatl, himself bearded, and to the practised eye one
of these would appear to be wearing a false hirsute appendage, as kings
were wont to do in ancient Egypt. Were these beards artificial and
symbolical?</p>

<p class="par first">The imposing pile of the Casa del Gobernador
(Governor&rsquo;s Palace, so called) at Uxmal is perhaps the best known
and described of all the aboriginal buildings of Central America. It
occupies three successive colossal terraces, and its frieze runs in a
line of 325 feet, and is divided into panels, each of which frames a
gigantic head of priest or deity. The striking thing concerning this
edifice is that although it has been abandoned for over three hundred
years it is still almost as fresh architecturally as when it left the
builder&rsquo;s hands. Here and there a lintel has fallen, or stones
have been removed in a spirit of vandalism to assist in the erection of
a neighbouring <i>hacienda</i>, but on the whole we possess in it the
most unspoiled piece of Yucatec building in existence. On the side of
the palace where stands the main entrance, directly over the gateway,
is the most wonderful fretwork and ornamentation, carried out in high
relief, above which soar three eagles in hewn stone, surmounted by a
plumed human head. In the plinth are three heads, which in type recall
the Roman, surrounded by inscriptions. A clear proof of the comparative
lateness of the period in which Uxmal was built is found in the
circumstance that all the lintels over the doorways are of wood, of
which much still exists in a good state of preservation. Many of the
joists of the roofs were also of timber, and were fitted into the
stonework by means of specially carved ends.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is also a nunnery which forcibly recalls
that at Chichen, and is quite as elaborate and flamboyant in its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=

Uxmal is the Casa del Adivino (The Prophet&rsquo;s House), also locally
known as &ldquo;The Dwarf&rsquo;s House.&rdquo; It consists of two
portions, one of which is on the summit of an artificial pyramid,
whilst the other, a small but beautifully finished chapel, is situated
lower down facing the town. The loftier building is reached by an
exceedingly steep staircase, and bears every evidence of having been
used as a sanctuary, for here were discovered cacao and copal, recently
burnt, by Cogolludo as late as 1656, which is good evidence that the
Yucatecs did not all at once abandon their ancient faith at the
promptings of the Spanish fathers.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Legend of the Dwarf</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In his <i>Travels in Yucatan</i> Stephens has a
legend relating to this house which may well be given in his own words:
&ldquo;An old woman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;lived alone in her hut,
rarely leaving her chimney-corner. She was much distressed at having no
children, and in her grief one day took an egg, wrapped it up carefully
in cotton cloth, and put it in a corner of her hut. She looked every
day in great anxiety, but no change in the egg was observable. One
morning, however, she found the shell broken, and a lovely tiny
creature was stretching out its arms to her. The old woman was in
raptures. She took it to her heart, gave it a nurse, and was so careful
of it that at the end of a year the baby walked and talked as well as a
grown-up man. But he stopped growing. The good old woman in her joy and
delight exclaimed that the baby should be a great chief. One day she
told him to go to the king&rsquo;s palace and engage him in a trial of
strength. The dwarf begged hard not to be sent on such an enterprise.
But the old woman insisted on his going, and he was obliged to obey.
When ushered into the presence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>of the sovereign he threw
down his gauntlet. The latter smiled, and asked him to lift a stone of
three arobes (75 lb.). The child returned crying to his mother, who
sent him back, saying, &lsquo;If the king can lift the stone, you can
lift it too.&rsquo; The king did take it up, but so did the dwarf. His
strength was tried in many other ways, but all the king did was as
easily done by the dwarf. Wroth at being outdone by so puny a creature,
the prince told the dwarf that unless he built a palace loftier than
any in the city he should die. The affrighted dwarf returned to the old
woman, who bade him not to despair, and the next morning they both
awoke in the palace which is still standing. The king saw the palace
with amazement. He instantly sent for the dwarf, and desired him to
collect two bundles of <i>cogoiol</i> (a kind of hard wood), with one
of which he would strike the dwarf on the head, and consent to be
struck in return by his tiny adversary. The latter again returned to
his mother moaning and lamenting. But the old woman cheered him up,
and, placing a <i>tortilla</i> on his head, sent him back to the king.
The trial took place in the presence of all the state grandees. The
king broke the whole of his bundle on the dwarf&rsquo;s head without
hurting him in the least, seeing which he wished to save his own head
from the impending ordeal; but his word had been passed before his
assembled court, and he could not well refuse. The dwarf struck, and at
the second blow the king&rsquo;s skull was broken to pieces. The
spectators immediately proclaimed the victorious dwarf their sovereign.
After this the old woman disappeared. But in the village of Mani, fifty
miles distant, is a deep well leading to a subterraneous passage which
extends as far as Merida. In this passage is an old woman sitting on
the bank of a river shaded by a great tree, having a serpent by her
side. She sells water in small quantities, accepting no money, for she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>must have human beings, innocent babies, which
are devoured by the serpent. This old woman is the dwarf&rsquo;s
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The interpretation of this myth is by no means
difficult. The old woman is undoubtedly the rain-goddess, the dwarf the
Man of the Sun who emerges from the cosmic egg. In Yucatan dwarfs were
sacred to the sun-god, and were occasionally sacrificed to him, for
reasons which appear obscure.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mound of Sacrifice</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Another building at Uxmal the associations of
which render it of more than passing interest is the Pyramid of
Sacrifice, an edifice built on the plan of the Mexican <i>teocalli</i>.
Indeed, it is probably of Aztec origin, and may even have been erected
by the mercenaries who during the fifteenth century swarmed from Mexico
into Yucatan and Guatemala to take service with the rival chieftains
who carried on civil war in those states. Beside this is another mound
which was crowned by a very beautiful temple, now in an advanced state
of ruin. The &ldquo;Pigeon House&rdquo; is an ornate pile with
pinnacles pierced by large openings which probably served as dovecotes.
The entire architecture of Uxmal displays a type more primitive than
that met elsewhere in Yucatan. There is documentary evidence to prove
that so late as 1673 the Indians still worshipped in the ruins of
Uxmal, where they burnt copal, and performed &ldquo;other detestable
sacrifices.&rdquo; So that even a hundred and fifty years of Spanish
rule had not sufficed to wean the natives from the worship of the older
gods to whom their fathers had for generations bowed down. This would
also seem conclusive evidence that the ruins of Uxmal at least were the
work of the existing race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In his <i>Travels in Central America</i> Stephens
recounts a fascinating story told him by a priest of Santa Cruz del
Quiche, to the effect that four days&rsquo; journey from that place a
great Indian city was to be seen, densely populated, and preserving the
ancient civilisation of the natives. He had, indeed, beheld it from the
summit of a cliff, shining in glorious whiteness many leagues away.
This was perhaps Lorillard City, discovered by Suarez, and afterwards
by Charnay. In general type Lorillard closely resembles Palenque. Here
was found a wonderfully executed stone idol, which Charnay thought
represented a different racial type from that seen in the other Central
American cities. The chief finds of interest in this ancient city were
the intricate bas-reliefs, one over the central door of a temple,
probably a symbolic representation of Quetzalcoatl, who holds the
rain-cross, in both hands, and is seen <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> with an
acolyte, also holding the symbol, though it is possible that the
individual represented may have been the high-priest of Quetzalcoatl or
Kukulcan. Another bas-relief represents a priest sacrificing to
Kukulcan by passing a rope of maguey fibre over his tongue for the
purpose of drawing blood&mdash;an instance of the substitution in
sacrifice of the part for the whole.</p>

<p class="par first">At Peten-Itza, Cort&eacute;s left his horse, which
had fallen sick, to the care of the Indians. The animal died under
their mismanagement and because of the food offered it, and the
terrified natives, fancying it a divine being, raised an image of it,
and called it Izimin Chac (Thunder and Lightning), because they had
seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>its rider discharge a firearm, and they imagined
that the flash and the report had proceeded from the creature. The
sight of the idol aroused such wrath in the zealous bosom of a certain
Spanish monk that he broke it with a huge stone&mdash;and, but for the
interference of the <i>cacique</i>, would have suffered death for his
temerity. Peten was a city &ldquo;filled with idols,&rdquo; as was
Tayasal, close at hand, where in the seventeenth century no less than
nine new temples were built, which goes to prove that the native
religion was by no means extinct. One of these new temples, according
to Villagutierre, had a Spanish balcony of hewn stone! In the Temple of
the Sun at Tikal, an adjoining city, is a wonderful altar panel,
representing an unknown deity, and here also are many of those
marvellously carved idols of which Stephens gives such capital
illustrations in his fascinating book.</p>

<p class="par first">Copan, one of the most interesting of these
wondrous city-centres, the name of which has, indeed, become almost a
household word, is in the same district as the towns just described,
and abounds chiefly in monolithic images. It yielded after a desperate
struggle to Hernandez de Chaves, one of Alvarado&rsquo;s lieutenants,
in 1530. The monolithic images so abundantly represented here are
evolved from the stel&aelig; and the bas-relief, and are not statues in
the proper sense of the term, as they are not completely cut away from
the stone background out of which they were carved. An altar found at
Copan exhibits real skill in sculpture, the head-dresses, ornaments,
and expressions of the eight figures carved on its sides being
elaborate in the extreme and exceedingly lifelike. Here again we notice
a fresh racial type, which goes to prove that one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>race
alone cannot have been responsible for these marvellous ruined cities
and all that they contain and signify. We have to imagine a shifting of
races and a fluctuation of peoples in Central America such as we know
took place in Europe and Asia before we can rightly understand the
ethnological problems of the civilised sphere of the New World, and any
theory which does not take due account of such conditions is doomed to
failure.</p>

remnants of a vanished civilisation&mdash;Mitla, by no means the least
of the works of civilised man in Central America. At the period of the
conquest the city occupied a wide area, but at the present time only
six palaces and three ruined pyramids are left standing. The great
palace is a vast edifice in the shape of the letter <span class=

with an apartment of a like size. Six monolithic columns which
supported the roof still stand in gigantic isolation, but the roof
itself has long fallen in. A dark passage leads to the inner court, and
the walls of this are covered with mosaic work in panels which recalls
somewhat the pattern known as the &ldquo;Greek fret.&rdquo; The lintels
over the doorways are of huge blocks of stone nearly eighteen feet
long. Of this building Viollet-le-Duc says: &ldquo;The monuments of
Greece and Rome in their best time can alone compare with the splendour
of this great edifice.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">A Place of Sepulture</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The ruins at Mitla bear no resemblance to those of
Mexico or Yucatan, either as regards architecture or ornamentation, for
whereas the Yucatec buildings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>possess overlapping walls,
the palaces of Mitla consist of perpendicular walls intended to support
flat roofs. Of these structures the second and fourth palaces alone are
in such a state of preservation as to permit of general description.
The second palace shows by its sculptured lintel and two inner columns
that the same arrangement was observed in its construction as in the
great palace just described. The fourth palace has on its southern
fa&ccedil;ade oblong panels and interesting caryatides or pillars in
the shape of human figures. These palaces consisted of four upper
apartments, finely sculptured, and a like number of rooms on the lower
story, which was occupied by the high-priest, and to which the king
came to mourn on the demise of a relative. Here, too, the priests were
entombed, and in an adjoining room the idols were kept. Into a huge
underground chamber the bodies of eminent warriors and sacrificial
victims were cast. Attempts have been made to identify Mitla with
Mictlan, the Mexican Hades, and there is every reason to suppose that
the identification is correct. It must be borne in mind that Mictlan
was as much a place of the dead as a place of punishment, as was the
Greek Hades, and therefore might reasonably signify a place of
sepulture, such as Mitla undoubtedly was. The following passages from
the old historians of Mitla, Torquemada and Burgoa, throw much light on
this aspect of the city, and besides are full of the most intense
interest and curious information, so that they may be given <i lang=
"la">in extenso</i>. But before passing on to them we should for a
moment glance at Seler&rsquo;s suggestion that the American race
imagined that their ancestors had originally issued from the underworld
through certain caverns into the light of day, and that this was the
reason why Mitla was not only a burial-place but a sanctuary.</p>

<h3 class="main">An Old Description of Mitla</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of Mitla Father Torquemada writes:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When some monks of my order, the Franciscan,
passed, preaching and shriving, through the province of Zapoteca, whose
capital city is Tehuantepec, they came to a village which was called
Mictlan, that is, Underworld [Hell]. Besides mentioning the large
number of people in the village they told of buildings which were
prouder and more magnificent than any which they had hitherto seen in
New Spain. Among them was a temple of the evil spirit and living-rooms
for his demoniacal servants, and among other fine things there was a
hall with ornamented panels, which were constructed of stone in a
variety of arabesques and other very remarkable designs. There were
doorways there, each one of which was built of but three stones, two
upright at the sides and one across them, in such a manner that,
although these doorways were very high and broad, the stones sufficed
for their entire construction. They were so thick and broad that we
were assured there were few like them. There was another hall in these
buildings, or rectangular temples, which was erected entirely on round
stone pillars, very high and very thick, so thick that two grown men
could scarcely encircle them with their arms, nor could one of them
reach the finger-tips of the other. These pillars were all in one
piece, and, it was said, the whole shaft of a pillar measured 5 ells
from top to bottom, and they were very much like those of the Church of
Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, very skilfully made and
polished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Father Burgoa gives a more exact description. He
says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Palace of the Living and of the Dead was
built <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>for the use of this person [the high-priest of
the Zapotecs].... They built this magnificent house or pantheon in the
shape of a rectangle, with portions rising above the earth and portions
built down into the earth, the latter in the hole or cavity which was
found below the surface of the earth, and ingeniously made the chambers
of equal size by the manner of joining them, leaving a spacious court
in the middle; and in order to secure four equal chambers they
accomplished what barbarian heathen (as they were) could only achieve
by the powers and skill of an architect. It is not known in what
stone-pit they quarried the pillars, which are so thick that two men
can scarcely encircle them with their arms. These are, to be sure, mere
shafts without capital or pedestal, but they are wonderfully regular
and smooth, and they are about 5 ells high and in one piece. These
served to support the roof, which consists of stone slabs instead of
beams. The slabs are about 2 ells long, 1 ell broad, and half an ell
thick, extending from pillar to pillar. The pillars stand in a row, one
behind the other, in order to receive the weight. The stone slabs are
so regular and so exactly fitted that, without any mortar or cement, at
the joints they resemble mortised beams. The four rooms, which are very
spacious, are arranged in exactly the same way and covered with the
same kind of roofing. But in the construction of the walls the greatest
architects of the earth have been surpassed, as I have not found this
kind of architecture described either among the Egyptians or among the
Greeks, for they begin at the base with a narrow outline and, as the
structure rises in height, spread out in wide copings at the top, so
that the upper part exceeds the base in breadth and looks as if it
would fall over. The inner side of the walls consists of a mortar or
stucco of such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>hardness that no one knows with what kind of
liquid it could have been mixed. The outside is of such extraordinary
workmanship that on a masonry wall about an ell in height there are
placed stone slabs with a projecting edge, which form the support for
an endless number of small white stones, the smallest of which are a
sixth of an ell long, half as broad, and a quarter as thick, and which
are as smooth and regular as if they had all come from one mould. They
had so many of these stones that, setting them in, one beside the
other, they formed with them a large number of different beautiful
geometric designs, each an ell broad and running the whole length of
the wall, each varying in pattern up to the crowning piece, which was
the finest of all. And what has always seemed inexplicable to the
greatest architects is the adjustment of these little stones without a
single handful of mortar, and the fact that without tools, with nothing
but hard stones and sand, they could achieve such solid work that,
though the whole structure is very old and no one knows who made it, it
has been preserved until the present day.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;I carefully examined these monuments some
thirty years ago in the chambers above ground, which are constructed of
the same size and in the same way as those below ground, and, though
single pieces were in ruins because some stones had become loosened,
there was still much to admire. The doorways were very large, the sides
of each being of single stones of the same thickness as the wall, and
the lintel was made out of another stone which held the two lower ones
together at the top. There were four chambers above ground and four
below. The latter were arranged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>according to their purpose in
such a way that one front chamber served as chapel and sanctuary for
the idols, which were placed on a great stone which served as an altar.
And for the more important feasts which they celebrated with
sacrifices, or at the burial of a king or great lord, the high-priest
instructed the lesser priests or the subordinate temple officials who
served him to prepare the chapel and his vestments and a large quantity
of the incense used by them. And then he descended with a great
retinue, while none of the common people saw him or dared to look in
his face, convinced that if they did so they would fall dead to the
earth as a punishment for their boldness. And when he entered the
chapel they put on him a long white cotton garment made like an alb,
and over that a garment shaped like a dalmatic, which was embroidered
with pictures of wild beasts and birds; and they put a cap on his head,
and on his feet a kind of shoe woven of many coloured feathers. And
when he had put on these garments he walked with solemn mien and
measured step to the altar, bowed low before the idols, renewed the
incense, and then in quite unintelligible murmurs he began to converse
with these images, these depositories of infernal spirits, and
continued in this sort of prayer with hideous grimaces and writhings,
uttering inarticulate sounds, which filled all present with fear and
terror, till he came out of that diabolical trance and told those
standing around the lies and fabrications which the spirit had imparted
to him or which he had invented himself. When human beings were
sacrificed the ceremonies were multiplied, and the assistants of the
high-priest stretched the victim out upon a large stone, baring his
breast, which they tore open with a great stone knife, while the body
writhed in fearful convulsions, and they laid the heart bare,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>ripping it out, and with it the soul, which the
devil took, while they carried the heart to the high-priest that he
might offer it to the idols by holding it to their mouths, among other
ceremonies; and the body was thrown into the burial-place of their
&lsquo;blessed,&rsquo; as they called them. And if after the sacrifice
he felt inclined to detain those who begged any favour he sent them
word by the subordinate priests not to leave their houses till their
gods were appeased, and he commanded them to do penance meanwhile, to
fast and to speak with no woman, so that, until this father of sin had
interceded for the absolution of the penitents and had declared the
gods appeased, they did not dare to cross their thresholds.</p>

leagues underground, and that its roof was supported by pillars. And
there were people, zealous prelates anxious for knowledge, who, in
order to convince these ignorant people of their error, went into this
cave accompanied by a large number of people bearing lighted torches
and firebrands, and descended several large steps. And they soon came
upon many great buttresses which formed a kind of street. They had

short distance, fearing to be overpowered by the stench, or to step on
poisonous reptiles, of which some had been seen, they resolved to go
out again, and to completely wall up this back door of hell. The four
buildings above ground were the only ones which still remained open,
and they had a court and chambers like those underground; and the ruins
of these have lasted even to the present day.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;One of the rooms above ground was the
palace of the high-priest, where he sat and slept, for the apartment
offered room and opportunity for everything. The throne was like a high
cushion, with a high back to lean against, all of tiger-skin, stuffed
entirely with delicate feathers, or with fine grass which was used for
this purpose. The other seats were smaller, even when the king came to
visit him. The authority of this devilish priest was so great that
there was no one who dared to cross the court, and to avoid this the
other three chambers had doors in the rear, through which even the
kings entered. For this purpose they had alleys and passage-ways on the
outside above and below, by which people could enter and go out when
they came to see the high-priest....</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The second chamber above ground was that of the
priests and the assistants of the high-priest. The third was that of
the king when he came. The fourth was that of the other chieftains and
captains, and though the space was small for so great a number, and for
so many different families, yet they accommodated themselves to each
other out of respect for the place, and avoided <span class=

no other administration of justice in this place than that of the
high-priest, to whose unlimited power all bowed.</p>

maize, was white and well kneaded. Their drinks were always cold, made

<h3 class="main">Mythology of the Maya</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Our knowledge of the mythology of the Maya is by
no means so full and comprehensive as in the case of Mexican mythology.
Traditions are few and obscure, and the hieroglyphic matter is closed
to us. But one great mine of Maya-Kiche mythology exists which
furnishes us with much information regarding Kiche cosmogony and
pseudo-history, with here and there an interesting allusion to the
various deities of the Kiche pantheon. This is the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, a
volume in which a little real history is mingled with much mythology.
It was composed in the form in which we now possess it by a
Christianised native of Guatemala in the seventeenth century, and
copied in Kiche, in which it was originally written, by one Francisco
Ximenes, a monk, who also added to it a Spanish translation.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">For generations antiquarians interested in this
wonderful compilation were aware that it existed somewhere in
Guatemala, and many were the regrets expressed regarding their
inability to unearth it. A certain Don Felix Cabrera had made use of it
early in the nineteenth century, but the whereabouts of the copy he had
seen could not be discovered. A Dr. C. Scherzer, of Austria, resolved,
if possible, to discover it, and paid a visit to Guatemala in 1854 for
that purpose. After a diligent search he succeeded in finding the lost
manuscript in the University of San Carlos in the city of Guatemala.
Ximenes, the copyist, had placed it in the library of the convent of
Chichicastenango, whence it passed to the San Carlos library in 1830.

<h3 class="main">Genuine Character of the Work</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Much doubt has been cast upon the genuine
character of the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, principally by persons who were
almost if not entirely ignorant of the problems of pre-Columbian
history in America. Its genuine character, however, is by no means
difficult to prove. It has been stated that it is a mere
<i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of the known facts of Maya history
coloured by Biblical knowledge, a native version of the Christian
Bible. But such a theory will not stand when it is shown that the
matter it contains squares with the accepted facts of Mexican
mythology, upon which the <i>Popol Vuh</i> throws considerable light.
Moreover, the entire work bears the stamp of being a purely native
compilation, and has a flavour of great antiquity. Our knowledge of the
general principles of mythology, too, prepares us for the unqualified
acceptance of the material of the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, for we find there
the stories and tales, the conceptions and ideas connected with early
religion which are the property of no one people, but of all peoples
and races in an early social state.</p>

<h3 class="main">Likeness to other Pseudo-Histories</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We find in this interesting book a likeness to
many other works of early times. The <i>Popol Vuh</i> is, indeed, of
the same <i>genre</i> and class as the <i>Heimskringla</i> of Snorre,
the history of Saxo Grammaticus, the Chinese history in the <i>Five
Books</i>, the Japanese <i>Nihongi</i>, and many other similar
compilations. But it surpasses all these in pure interest because it is
the only native American work that has come down to us from
pre-Columbian times.</p>
<p class="par">The name &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; means &ldquo;The
Collection of Written Leaves,&rdquo; which proves that the book must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>have contained traditional matter reduced to
writing at a very early period. It is, indeed, a compilation of
mythological character, interspersed with pseudo-history, which, as the
account reaches modern times, shades off into pure history and tells
the deeds of authentic personages. The language in which it was
written, the Kiche, was a dialect of the Maya-Kiche tongue spoken at
the time of the conquest in Guatemala, Honduras, and San Salvador, and
still the tongue of the native populations in these districts.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Creation-Story</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The beginning of this interesting book is taken up
with the Kiche story of the creation, and what occurred directly
subsequent to that event. We are told that the god Hurakan, the mighty
wind, a deity in whom we can discern a Kiche equivalent to
Tezcatlipoca, passed over the universe, still wrapped in gloom. He
called out &ldquo;Earth,&rdquo; and the solid land appeared. Then the
chief gods took counsel among themselves as to what should next be
made. These were Hurakan, Gucumatz or Quetzalcoatl, and Xpiyacoc and
Xmucane, the mother and father gods. They agreed that animals should be
created. This was accomplished, and they next turned their attention to
the framing of man. They made a number of mannikins carved out of wood.
But these were irreverent and angered the gods, who resolved to bring
about their downfall. Then Hurakan (The Heart of Heaven) caused the
waters to be swollen, and a mighty flood came upon the mannikins. Also
a thick resinous rain descended upon them. The bird Xecotcovach tore
out their eyes, the bird Camulatz cut off their heads, the bird
Cotzbalam devoured their flesh, the bird Tecumbalam broke their bones
and sinews and ground them into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>powder. Then all sorts of
beings, great and small, abused the mannikins. The household utensils
and domestic animals jeered at them, and made game of them in their
plight. The dogs and hens said: &ldquo;Very badly have you treated us
and you have bitten us. Now we bite you in turn.&rdquo; The millstones
said: &ldquo;Very much were we tormented by you, and daily, daily,
night and day, it was squeak, screech, screech, holi, holi, huqi,
huqi,<a class="noteref" id="xd22e3695src" href="#xd22e3695" name=
"xd22e3695src">1</a> for your sake. Now you shall feel our strength,
and we shall grind your flesh and make meal of your bodies.&rdquo; And
the dogs growled at the unhappy images because they had not been fed,
and tore them with their teeth. The cups and platters said: &ldquo;Pain
and misery you gave us, smoking our tops and sides, cooking us over the
fire, burning and hurting us as if we had no feeling. Now it is your
turn, and you shall burn.&rdquo; The unfortunate mannikins ran hither
and thither in their despair. They mounted upon the roofs of the
houses, but the houses crumbled beneath their feet; they tried to climb
to the tops of the trees, but the trees hurled them down; they were
even repulsed by the caves, which closed before them. Thus this
ill-starred race was finally destroyed and overthrown, and the only
vestiges of them which remain are certain of their progeny, the little
monkeys which dwell in the woods.</p>

<h3 class="main">Vukub-Cakix, the Great Macaw</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ere the earth was quite recovered from the
wrathful flood which had descended upon it there lived a being orgulous
and full of pride, called Vukub-Cakix
(Seven-times-the-colour-of-fire&mdash;the Kiche name for the great
macaw bird). His teeth were of emerald, and other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>parts of him shone with the brilliance of gold
and silver. In short, it is evident that he was a sun-and-moon god of
prehistoric times. He boasted dreadfully, and his conduct so irritated
the other gods that they resolved upon his destruction. His two sons,
Zipacna and Cabrakan (Cockspur or Earth-heaper, and Earthquake), were
earthquake-gods of the type of the J&ouml;tuns of Scandinavian myth or
the Titans of Greek legend. These also were prideful and arrogant, and
to cause their downfall the gods despatched the heavenly twins Hun-Apu
and Xbalanque to earth, with instructions to chastise the trio.</p>
<p class="par">Vukub-Cakix prided himself upon his possession of the
wonderful nanze-tree, the tapal, bearing a fruit round, yellow, and
aromatic, upon which he breakfasted every morning. One morning he
mounted to its summit, whence he could best espy the choicest fruits,
when he was surprised and infuriated to observe that two strangers had
arrived there before him, and had almost denuded the tree of its
produce. On seeing Vukub, Hun-Apu raised a blow-pipe to his mouth and
blew a dart at the giant. It struck him on the mouth, and he fell from
the top of the tree to the ground. Hun-Apu leapt down upon Vukub and
grappled with him, but the giant in terrible anger seized the god by
the arm and wrenched it from the body. He then returned to his house,
where he was met by his wife, Chimalmat, who inquired for what reason
he roared with pain. In reply he pointed to his mouth, and so full of
anger was he against Hun-Apu that he took the arm he had wrenched from
him and hung it over a blazing fire. He then threw himself down to
bemoan his injuries, consoling himself, however, with the idea that he
had avenged himself upon the disturbers of his peace. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Whilst Vukub-Cakix moaned and howled with the dreadful
pain which he felt in his jaw and teeth (for the dart which had pierced
him was probably poisoned) the arm of Hun-Apu hung over the fire, and
was turned round and round and basted by Vukub&rsquo;s spouse,
Chimalmat. The sun-god rained bitter imprecations upon the interlopers
who had penetrated to his paradise and had caused him such woe, and he
gave vent to dire threats of what would happen if he succeeded in
getting them into his power.</p>
<p class="par">But Hun-Apu and Xbalanque were not minded that
Vukub-Cakix should escape so easily, and the recovery of
Hun-Apu&rsquo;s arm must be made at all hazards. So they went to
consult two great and wise magicians, Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, in whom we
see two of the original Kiche creative deities, who advised them to
proceed with them in disguise to the dwelling of Vukub, if they wished
to recover the lost arm. The old magicians resolved to disguise
themselves as doctors, and dressed Hun-Apu and Xbalanque in other
garments to represent their sons.</p>
<p class="par">Shortly they arrived at the mansion of Vukub, and while
still some way off they could hear his groans and cries. Presenting
themselves at the door, they accosted him. They told him that they had
heard some one crying out in pain, and that as famous doctors they
considered it their duty to ask who was suffering.</p>
<p class="par">Vukub appeared quite satisfied, but closely questioned
the old wizards concerning the two young men who accompanied them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are our sons,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Vukub. &ldquo;Do you think you
will be able to cure me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have no doubt whatever upon that head,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>answered Xpiyacoc. &ldquo;You have sustained
very bad injuries to your mouth and eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The demons who shot me with an arrow from their
blow-pipe are the cause of my sufferings,&rdquo; said Vukub. &ldquo;If
you are able to cure me I shall reward you richly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Highness has many bad teeth, which must be
removed,&rdquo; said the wily old magician. &ldquo;Also the balls of
your eyes appear to me to be diseased.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Vukub appeared highly alarmed, but the magicians
speedily reassured him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; said Xpiyacoc,
&ldquo;that we remove your teeth, but we will take care to replace them
with grains of maize, which you will find much more agreeable in every
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The unsuspicious giant agreed to the operation, and very
quickly Xpiyacoc, with the help of Xmucane, removed his teeth of
emerald, and replaced them by grains of white maize. A change quickly
came over the Titan. His brilliancy speedily vanished, and when they
removed the balls of his eyes he sank into insensibility and died.</p>
<p class="par">All this time the wife of Vukub was turning
Hun-Apu&rsquo;s arm over the fire, but Hun-Apu snatched the limb from
above the brazier, and with the help of the magicians replaced it upon
his shoulder. The discomfiture of Vukub was then complete. The party
left his dwelling feeling that their mission had been accomplished.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But in reality it was only partially accomplished,
because Vukub&rsquo;s two sons, Zipacna and Cabrakan, still remained to
be dealt with. Zipacna was daily employed in heaping up mountains,
while Cabrakan, his brother, shook them in earthquake. The vengeance of
Hun-Apu and Xbalanque was first directed against Zipacna, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>and
they conspired with a band of young men to bring about his death.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The young men, four hundred in number, pretended to be
engaged in building a house. They cut down a large tree, which they
made believe was to be the roof-tree of their dwelling, and waited in a
part of the forest through which they knew Zipacna must pass. After a
while they could hear the giant crashing through the trees. He came
into sight, and when he saw them standing round the giant tree-trunk,
which they could not lift, he seemed very much amused.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What have you there, O little ones?&rdquo; he
said laughing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only a tree, your Highness, which we have felled
for the roof-tree of a new house we are building.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cannot you carry it?&rdquo; asked the giant
disdainfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, your Highness,&rdquo; they made answer;
&ldquo;it is much too heavy to be lifted even by our united
efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With a good-natured laugh the Titan stooped and lifted
the great trunk upon his shoulder. Then, bidding them lead the way, he
trudged through the forest, evidently not disconcerted in the least by
his great burden. Now the young men, incited by Hun-Apu and Xbalanque,
had dug a great ditch, which they pretended was to serve for the
foundation of their new house. Into this they requested Zipacna to
descend, and, scenting no mischief, the giant readily complied. On his
reaching the bottom his treacherous acquaintances cast huge trunks of
trees upon him, but on hearing them coming down he quickly took refuge
in a small side tunnel which the youths had constructed to serve as a
cellar beneath their house.</p>
<p class="par">Imagining the giant to be killed, they began at once to
express their delight by singing and dancing, and to lend colour to his
stratagem Zipacna despatched several <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>friendly ants to the
surface with strands of hair, which the young men concluded had been
taken from his dead body. Assured by the seeming proof of his death,
the youths proceeded to build their house upon the tree-trunks which
they imagined covered Zipacna&rsquo;s body, and, producing a quantity
of <i>pulque</i>, they began to make merry over the end of their enemy.
For some hours their new dwelling rang with revelry.</p>
<p class="par">All this time Zipacna, quietly hidden below, was
listening to the hubbub and waiting his chance to revenge himself upon
those who had entrapped him.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly arising in his giant might, he cast the house
and all its inmates high in the air. The dwelling was utterly
demolished, and the band of youths were hurled with such force into the
sky that they remained there, and in the stars we call the Pleiades we
can still discern them wearily waiting an opportunity to return to
earth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But Hun-Apu and Xbalanque, grieved that their
comrades had so perished, resolved that Zipacna must not be permitted
to escape so easily. He, carrying the mountains by night, sought his
food by day on the shore of the river, where he wandered catching fish
and crabs. The brothers made a large artificial crab, which they placed
in a cavern at the bottom of a ravine. They then cunningly undermined a
huge mountain, and awaited events. Very soon they saw Zipacna wandering
along the side of the river, and asked him where he was going.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I am only seeking my daily food,&rdquo;
replied the giant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And what may that consist of?&rdquo; asked the
brothers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Only of fish and crabs,&rdquo; replied
Zipacna.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, there is a crab down yonder,&rdquo; said the
crafty brothers, pointing to the bottom of the ravine. &ldquo;We espied
it as we came along. Truly, it is a great crab, and will furnish you
with a capital breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Zipacna, with glistening
eyes. &ldquo;I must have it at once,&rdquo; and with one bound he leapt
down to where the cunningly contrived crab lay in the cavern.</p>
<p class="par">No sooner had he reached it than Hun-Apu and Xbalanque
cast the mountain upon him; but so desperate were his efforts to get
free that the brothers feared he might rid himself of the immense
weight of earth under which he was buried, and to make sure of his fate
they turned him into stone. Thus at the foot of Mount Meah&#365;an,
near Vera Paz, perished the proud Mountain-Maker.</p>

he.</p>
<p class="par">But Hun-Apu and Xbalanque had made up their minds that
not one of the race of Vukub should be left alive.</p>
<p class="par">At the moment when they were plotting the overthrow of
Cabrakan he was occupied in moving mountains. He seized the mountains
by their bases and, exerting his mighty strength, cast them into the
air; and of the smaller mountains he took no account at all. While he
was so employed he met the brothers, who greeted him cordially.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good day, Cabrakan,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;What
may you be doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah! nothing at all,&rdquo; replied the giant.
&ldquo;Cannot you see that I am throwing the mountains about, which

<p class="par">Cabrakan looked at the brothers disdainfully, and was
about to depart when they said to him: &ldquo;Stay; we should like to

<p class="par">This aroused the pride of Cabrakan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, since you wish it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I

mountain?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Without the least difficulty,&rdquo; replied
Cabrakan, with a great laugh. &ldquo;Let us go toward it.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;You have had no food since morning, and so great a feat can
hardly be accomplished fasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The giant smacked his lips. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo;
he said, with a hungry look. Cabrakan was one of those people who are
always hungry. &ldquo;But what have you to give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have nothing with us,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; growled Cabrakan, &ldquo;you are a
pretty fellow. You ask me what I will have to eat, and then tell me you
have nothing,&rdquo; and in his anger he seized one of the smaller
mountains and threw it into the sea, so that the waves splashed up to
the sky.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get
angry. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=

growled. &ldquo;But be quick, because I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Just at that moment a large bird passed overhead, and
Hun-Apu and Xbalanque raised their blow-pipes to their mouths. The
darts sped swiftly upward, and both of them struck the bird, which came
tumbling down through the air, falling at the feet of Cabrakan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo; cried the giant.
&ldquo;You are clever fellows indeed,&rdquo; and, seizing the dead
bird, he was going to eat it raw when Hun-Apu stopped him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It will be
much nicer when cooked,&rdquo; and, rubbing two sticks together, he
ordered Xbalanque to gather some dry wood, so that a fire was soon
blazing.</p>
<p class="par">The bird was then suspended over the fire, and in a
short time a savoury odour mounted to the nostrils of the giant, who
stood watching the cooking with hungry eyes and watering lips.</p>
<p class="par">Before placing the bird over the fire to cook, however,
Hun-Apu had smeared its feathers with a thick coating of mud. The
Indians in some parts of Central America still do this, so that when
the mud dries with the heat of the fire the feathers will come off with
it, leaving the flesh of the bird quite ready to eat. But Hun-Apu had
done this with a purpose. The mud that he spread on the feathers was
that of a poisoned earth, called <i>tizate</i>, the elements of which
sank deeply into the flesh of the bird.</p>
<p class="par">When the savoury mess was cooked, he handed it to
Cabrakan, who speedily devoured it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu, &ldquo;let us go toward
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>great mountain and see if you can lift it as you
boast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But already Cabrakan began to feel strange pangs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said he, passing his hand
across his brow. &ldquo;I do not seem to see the mountain you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu. &ldquo;Yonder it
is, see, to the east there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My eyes seem dim this morning,&rdquo; replied the
giant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, it is not that,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu.
&ldquo;You have boasted that you could lift this mountain, and now you
are afraid to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Cabrakan, &ldquo;that I
have difficulty in seeing. Will you lead me to the mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu, giving him his
hand, and with several strides they were at the foot of the
eminence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hun-Apu, &ldquo;see what you can
do, boaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Cabrakan gazed stupidly at the great mass in front of
him. His knees shook together so that the sound was like the beating of
a war-drum, and the sweat poured from his forehead and ran in a little
stream down the side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Hun-Apu derisively, &ldquo;are
you going to lift the mountain or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He cannot,&rdquo; sneered Xbalanque. &ldquo;I
knew he could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Cabrakan shook himself into a final effort to regain his
senses, but all to no purpose. The poison rushed through his blood, and
with a groan he fell dead before the brothers.</p>
<p class="par">Thus perished the last of the earth-giants of Guatemala,
whom Hun-Apu and Xbalanque had been sent to destroy. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The second book of the <i>Popol Vuh</i> outlines
the history of the hero-gods Hun-Apu and Xbalanque. We are told that
Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the father and mother gods, had two sons,
Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu, the first of whom had by his wife
Xbakiyalo two sons, Hunbatz and Hunchouen. The weakness of the whole
family was the native game of ball, possibly the Mexican-Mayan game of
<i>tlachtli</i>, a sort of hockey. To this pastime the natives of
Central America were greatly addicted, and numerous remains of
<i>tlachtli</i> courts are to be found in the ruined cities of Yucatan
and Guatemala. The object of the game was to &ldquo;putt&rdquo; the
ball through a small hole in a circular stone or goal, and the player
who succeeded in doing this might demand from the audience all their
clothes and jewels. The game, as we have said, was exceedingly popular
in ancient Central America, and there is good reason to believe that
inter-city matches took place between the various city-states, and were
accompanied by a partisanship and rivalry as keen as that which finds
expression among the crowd at our principal football matches
to-day.</p>

<p class="par first">On one occasion Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu played
a game of ball which in its progress took them into the vicinity of the
realm of Xibalba (the Kiche Hades). The rulers of that drear abode,
imagining that they had a chance of capturing the brothers, extended a
challenge to them to play them at ball, and this challenge Hun-Came and
Vukub-Came, the sovereigns of the Kiche Hell, despatched by four
messengers in the shape of owls. The brothers <span class=

<p class="par first">The American Indian is grave and taciturn. If
there is one thing he fears and dislikes more than another it is
ridicule. To his austere and haughty spirit it appears as something
derogatory to his dignity, a slur upon his manhood. The hero-brothers
had not been long in Xibalba when they discovered that it was the
intention of the Lords of Hades to fool them and subject them to every
species of indignity. After crossing a river of blood, they came to the
palace of the Lords of Xibalba, where they espied two seated figures in
front of them. Thinking that they recognised in them Hun-Came and
Vukub-Came, they saluted them in a becoming manner, only to discover to
their mortification that they were addressing figures of wood. This
incident excited the ribald jeers of the Xibalbans, who scoffed at the
brothers. Next they were invited to sit on the seat of honour, which
they found to their dismay to be a red-hot stone, a circumstance which
caused unbounded amusement to the inhabitants of the Underworld. Then
they were imprisoned in the House of Gloom, where they were sacrificed
and buried. The head of Hunhun-Apu was, however, suspended from a tree,
upon the branches of which grew a crop of gourds so like the dreadful
trophy as to be indistinguishable from it. The fiat went forth that no
one in Xibalba must eat of the fruit of that tree. But the Lords of
Xibalba had reckoned without feminine curiosity and its unconquerable
love of the forbidden. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=

(Blood), daughter of Cuchumaquiq, a notability of Xibalba, passed under
the tree, and, observing the desirable fruit with which it was covered,
stretched out her hand to pluck one of the gourds. Into the
outstretched palm the head of Hunhun-Apu spat, and told Xquiq that she
would become a mother. Before she returned home, however, the hero-god
assured her that no harm would come to her, and that she must not be
afraid. In a few months&rsquo; time the princess&rsquo;s father heard
of her adventure, and she was doomed to be slain, the royal messengers
of Xibalba, the owls, receiving commands to despatch her and to bring
back her heart in a vase. But on the way she overcame the scruples of
the owls by splendid promises, and they substituted for her heart the
coagulated sap of the bloodwort plant.</p>

the young Hunbatz and Hunchouen, and thither, at the instigation of the
head of Hunhun-Apu, went Xquiq for protection. At first Xmucane would
not credit her story, but upon Xquiq appealing to the gods a miracle
was performed on her behalf, and she was permitted to gather a basket
of maize where no maize grew to prove the authenticity of her claim. As
a princess of the Underworld, it is not surprising that she should be
connected with such a phenomenon, as it is from deities of that region
that we usually expect the phenomena of growth to proceed. Shortly
afterwards, when she had won the good graces of the aged <span class=

shrill uproar and tricky behaviour. At last Xmucane, unable to put up
with their habits, turned them out of doors. They took to an outdoor
life with surprising ease, and soon became expert hunters and skilful
in the use of the <i>serbatana</i> (blow-pipe), with which they shot
birds and small animals. They were badly treated by their half-brothers
Hunbatz and Hunchouen, who, jealous of their fame as hunters, annoyed
them in every possible manner. But the divine children retaliated by
turning their tormentors into hideous apes. The sudden change in the
appearance of her grandsons caused Xmucane the most profound grief and
dismay, and she begged that they who had brightened her home with their
singing and flute-playing might not be condemned to such a dreadful
fate. She was informed by the divine brothers that if she could behold
their antics unmoved by mirth her wish would be granted. But the capers
they cut and their grimaces caused her such merriment that on three
separate occasions she was unable to restrain her laughter, and the
men-monkeys took their leave.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Magic Tools</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The childhood of Hun-Apu and Xbalanque was full of
such episodes as might be expected from these beings. We find, for
example, that on attempting to clear a <i>milpa</i> (maize plantation)
they employed magic tools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>which could be trusted to
undertake a good day&rsquo;s work whilst they were absent at the chase.
Returning at night, they smeared soil over their hands and faces, for
the purpose of deluding Xmucane into the belief that they had been
toiling all day in the fields. But the wild beasts met in conclave
during the night, and replaced all the roots and shrubs which the magic
tools had cleared away. The twins recognised the work of the various
animals, and placed a large net on the ground, so that if the creatures
came to the spot on the following night they might be caught in its
folds. They did come, but all made good their escape save the rat. The
rabbit and deer lost their tails, however, and that is why these
animals possess no caudal appendages! The rat, in gratitude for their
sparing its life, told the brothers the history of their father and
uncle, of their heroic efforts against the powers of Xibalba, and of
the existence of a set of clubs and balls with which they might play
<i>tlachtli</i> on the ball-ground at Ninxor-Carchah, where Hunhun-Apu
and Vukub-Hunapu had played before them.</p>

<p class="par first">But the watchful Hun-Came and Vukub-Came soon
heard that the sons and nephews of their first victims had adopted the
game which had led these last into the clutches of the cunning
Xibalbans, and they resolved to send a similar challenge to Hun-Apu and
Xbalanque, thinking that the twins were unaware of the fate of
Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu. They therefore despatched messengers to
the home of Xmucane with a challenge to play them at the ball-game, and
Xmucane, alarmed by the nature of the message, sent a louse to warn her
grandsons. The louse, unable to proceed as quickly as he wished,
permitted himself to be swallowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>by a toad, the toad by a
serpent, and the serpent by the bird Voc, the messenger of Hurakan. At
the end of the journey the other animals duly liberated each other, but
the toad could not rid himself of the louse, who had in reality hidden
himself in the toad&rsquo;s gums, and had not been swallowed at all. At
last the message was delivered, and the twins returned to the abode of
Xmucane, to bid farewell to their grandmother and mother. Before
leaving they each planted a cane in the midst of the hut, saying that
it would wither if any fatal accident befell them.</p>

trodden by Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu, and passed the river of blood
as the others had done. But they adopted the precaution of despatching
ahead an animal called Xan as a sort of spy or scout. They commanded
this animal to prick all the Xibalbans with a hair from Hun-Apu&rsquo;s
leg, in order that they might discover which of them were made of wood,
and incidentally learn the names of the others as they addressed one
another when pricked by the hair. They were thus enabled to ignore the
wooden images on their arrival at Xibalba, and they carefully avoided
the red-hot stone. Nor did the ordeal of the House of Gloom affright
them, and they passed through it scatheless. The inhabitants of the
Underworld were both amazed and furious with disappointment. To add to
their annoyance, they were badly beaten in the game of ball which
followed. The Lords of Hell then requested the twins to bring them four
bouquets of flowers from the royal garden of Xibalba, at the same time
commanding the gardeners to keep good watch over the flowers so that
none of them might be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=

to their aid a swarm of ants, who succeeded in returning with the
flowers. The anger of the Xibalbans increased to a white fury, and they
incarcerated Hun-Apu and Xbalanque in the House of Lances, a dread
abode where demons armed with sharp spears thrust at them fiercely. But
they bribed the lancers and escaped. The Xibalbans slit the beaks of
the owls who guarded the royal gardens, and howled in fury.</p>

they escaped a dreadful death from freezing by warming themselves with
burning pine-cones. Into the House of Tigers and the House of Fire they
were thrown for a night each, but escaped from both. But they were not
so lucky in the House of Bats. As they threaded this place of terror,
Camazotz, Ruler of the Bats, descended upon them with a whirring of
leathern wings, and with one sweep of his sword-like claws cut off
Hun-Apu&rsquo;s head. (See Mictlan, pp. 95, 96.) But a tortoise which
chanced to pass the severed neck of the hero&rsquo;s prostrate body and
came into contact with it was immediately turned into a head, and
Hun-Apu arose from his terrible experience not a whit the worse.</p>
<p class="par">These various houses in which the brothers were forced
to pass a certain time forcibly recall to our minds the several circles
of Dante&rsquo;s Hell. Xibalba was to the Kiche not a place of
punishment, but a dark place of horror and myriad dangers. No wonder
the Maya had what Landa calls &ldquo;an immoderate fear of death&rdquo;
if they believed that after it they would be transported to such a
dread abode!</p>
<p class="par">With the object of proving their immortal nature to
their adversaries, Hun-Apu and Xbalanque, first <span class=

sorcerers, Xulu and Pacaw, stretched themselves upon a bier and died.
Their bones were ground to powder and thrown into the river. They then
went through a kind of evolutionary process, appearing on the fifth day
after their deaths as men-fishes and on the sixth as old men, ragged
and tatterdemalion in appearance, killing and restoring each other to
life. At the request of the princes of Xibalba, they burned the royal
palace and restored it to its pristine splendour, killed and
resuscitated the king&rsquo;s dog, and cut a man in pieces, bringing
him to life again. The Lords of Hell were curious about the sensation
of death, and asked to be killed and resuscitated. The first portion of
their request the hero-brothers speedily granted, but did not deem it
necessary to pay any regard to the second.</p>
<p class="par">Throwing off all disguise, the brothers assembled the
now thoroughly cowed princes of Xibalba, and announced their intention
of punishing them for their animosity against themselves, their father
and uncle. They were forbidden to partake in the noble and classic game
of ball&mdash;a great indignity in the eyes of Maya of the higher
caste&mdash;they were condemned to menial tasks, and they were to have
sway over the beasts of the forest alone. After this their power
rapidly waned. These princes of the Underworld are described as being
owl-like, with faces painted black and white, as symbolical of their
duplicity and faithless disposition.</p>
<p class="par">As some reward for the dreadful indignities they had
undergone, the souls of Hunhun-Apu and Vukub-Hunapu, the first
adventurers into the darksome region of Xibalba, were translated to the
skies, and became the sun and moon, and with this apotheosis the second
book ends.</p>
<p class="par">We can have no difficulty, in the light of comparative
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>mythology, in seeing in the matter of this book
a version of &ldquo;the harrying of hell&rdquo; common to many
mythologies. In many primitive faiths a hero or heroes dares the
countless dangers of Hades in order to prove to the savage mind that
the terrors of death can be overcome. In Algonquian mythology Blue-Jay
makes game of the Dead Folk whom his sister Ioi has married, and Balder
passes through the Scandinavian Helheim. The god must first descend
into the abyss and must emerge triumphant if humble folk are to possess
assurance of immortality.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Reality of Myth</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is from such matter as that found in the second
book of the <i>Popol Vuh</i> that we are enabled to discern how real
myth can be on occasion. It is obvious, as has been pointed out, that
the dread of death in the savage mind may give rise to such a
conception of its vanquishment as appears in the <i>Popol Vuh</i>. But
there is reason to suspect that other elements have also entered into
the composition of the myth. It is well known that an invading race,
driving before them the remnants of a conquered people, are prone to
regard these in the course of a few generations as almost supernatural
and as denizens of a sphere more or less infernal. Their reasons for
this are not difficult of comprehension. To begin with, a difference in
ceremonial ritual gives rise to the belief that the inimical race
practises magic. The enemy is seldom seen, and, if perceived, quickly
takes cover or &ldquo;vanishes.&rdquo; The majority of aboriginal races
were often earth- or cave-dwellers, like the Picts of Scotland, and
such the originals of the Xibalbans probably were.</p>
<p class="par">The invading Maya-Kiche, encountering such a folk in the
cavernous recesses of the hill-slopes of Guatemala, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>would naturally refer them to the Underworld.
The cliff-dwellings of Mexico and Colorado exhibit manifest signs of
the existence of such a cave-dwelling race. In the latter state is the
Cliff Palace Ca&ntilde;on, a huge natural recess, within which a small
city was actually built, which still remains in excellent preservation.
In some such semi-subterranean recess, then, may the city of
&ldquo;Xibalba&rdquo; have stood.</p>

<p class="par first">We can see, too, that the Xibalbans were not
merely a plutonic race. Xibalba is not a Hell, a place of punishment
for sin, but a place of the dead, and its inhabitants were scarcely
&ldquo;devils,&rdquo; nor evil gods. The transcriber of the <i>Popol
Vuh</i> says of them: &ldquo;In the old times they did not have much
power. They were but annoyers and opposers of men, and, in truth, they
were not regarded as gods.&rdquo; The word Xibalba is derived from a
root meaning &ldquo;to fear,&rdquo; from which comes the name for a
ghost or phantom. Xibalba was thus the &ldquo;Place of
Phantoms.&rdquo;</p>

more deliberating as to the creation of man. Four men are evolved as
the result of these deliberations. These beings were moulded from a
paste of yellow and white maize, and were named Balam-Quitze (Tiger
with the Sweet Smile), Balam-Agab (Tiger of the Night), Mahacutah (The
Distinguished Name), and Iqi-Balam (Tiger of the Moon).</p>
<p class="par">But the god Hurakan who had formed them was not
overpleased with his handiwork, for these beings were too much like the
gods themselves. The gods once more took counsel, and agreed that man
must be less perfect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230"

race. He must not become as a god. So Hurakan breathed a cloud over
their eyes in order that they might only see a portion of the earth,
whereas before they had been able to see the whole round sphere of the
world. After this the four men were plunged into a deep sleep, and four
women were created, who were given them as wives. These were
Caha-Paluma (Falling Water), Choima (Beautiful Water), Tzununiha (House
of the Water), and Cakixa (Water of Parrots, or Brilliant Water), who
were espoused to the men in the respective order given above.</p>

they journeyed to a place called Tulan-Zuiva (The Seven
Caves)&mdash;practically the same as Chicomoztoc in the Aztec
myth&mdash;and there gods were vouchsafed to them. The names of these
were Tohil, whom Balam-Quitze received; Avilix, whom Balam-Agab
received; and Hacavitz, granted to Mahacutah. Iqi-Balam received a god,
but as he had no family his worship and knowledge died out.</p>

for here the race suffered alienation in its different branches by
reason of a confounding of their speech, which recalls the story of
Babel. Owing to this the first four men were no longer able to
comprehend each other, and determined to leave the place of their
mischance and to seek the leadership of the god Tohil into another and
more fortunate sphere. In this journey they met with innumerable
hardships. They had to cross many lofty mountains, and on one occasion
had to make a long <i lang="fr">d&eacute;tour</i> across the bed of the
ocean, the waters of which were miraculously divided to permit of their
passage. At last they arrived at a mountain which they called Hacavitz,
after one of their deities, and here they remained, for it had been
foretold that here they should see the sun. At last the luminary
appeared. Men and beasts went wild with delight, although his beams
were by no means strong, and he appeared more like a reflection in a
mirror than the strong sun of later days whose fiery beams speedily
sucked up the blood of victims on the altar. As he showed his face the
three tribal gods of the Kiche were turned into stone, as were the gods
or totems connected with the wild animals. Then arose the first Kiche
town, or permanent dwelling-place.</p>

their dying words. In the grief of their souls they chanted the song
&ldquo;Kamucu,&rdquo; the song &ldquo;We see,&rdquo; that they had sung
so joyfully when they had first seen the light of day. Then they parted
from their wives and sons one by one. And of a sudden they were not,

called the &ldquo;Majesty Enveloped.&rdquo; So died the first men of

<p class="par">In this book it is clear that we have to deal with the
problem which the origin and creation of man presented to the
Maya-Kiche mind. The several myths connected with it bear a close
resemblance to those of other American peoples. In the mythology of the
American Indian it is rare to find an Adam, a single figure set
solitary in a world without companionship of some sort. Man is almost
invariably the child of Mother Earth, and emerges from some cavern or
subterranean country fully grown and fully equipped for the upper
earth-life. We find this type of myth in the mythologies of the Aztecs,
Peruvians, Choctaws, Blackfeet Indians, and those of many other
American tribes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233"

<h3 class="main">American Migrations</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We also find in the story of the Kiche migration a
striking similarity to the migration myths of other American races. But
in the Kiche myth we can trace a definite racial movement from the cold
north to the warm south. The sun is not at first born. There is
darkness. When he does appear he is weak and his beams are dull and
watery like those of the luminary in a northern clime. Again, there are
allusions to the crossing of rivers by means of &ldquo;shining
sand&rdquo; which covered them, which might reasonably be held to imply
the presence upon them of ice. In this connection we may quote from an
Aztec migration myth which appears almost a parallel to the Kiche
story.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is the beginning of the record of the coming
of the Mexicans from the place called Aztlan. It is by means of the
water that they came this way, being four tribes, and in coming they
rowed in boats. They built their huts on piles at the place called the
grotto of Quineveyan. It is there from which the eight tribes issued.
The first tribe is that of the Huexotzincos, the second the Chalcas,
the third the Xochimilcos, the fourth the Cuitlavacas, the fifth the
Mallinalcas, the sixth the Chichimecas, the seventh the Tepanecas, the
eighth the Matlatzincas. It is there where they were founded in
Colhuacan. They were the colonists of it since they landed there,
coming from Aztlan.... It is there that they soon afterwards went away
from, carrying with them their god Vitzillopochtli.... There the eight
tribes opened up our road by water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Wallum Olum,&rdquo; or painted calendar
records, of the Leni-Lenape Indians contain a similar myth.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>&ldquo;After the flood,&rdquo; says the story,
&ldquo;the Lenape with the manly turtle beings dwelt close together at
the cave house and dwelling of Talli.... They saw that the snake-land
was bright and wealthy. Having all agreed, they went over the water of
the frozen sea to possess the land. It was wonderful when they all went
over the smooth deep water of the frozen sea at the gap of the snake
sea in the great ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Do these myths contain any essence of the truth? Do they
refer to an actual migration when the ancestors of certain American
tribes crossed the frozen ocean of the Kamchatka Strait and descended
from the sunless north and the boreal night of these sub-Arctic regions
to a more genial clime? Can such a tradition have been preserved
throughout the countless ages which must have passed between the
arrival of proto-Mongolian man in America and the writing or
composition of the several legends cited? Surely not. But may there not
have been later migrations from the north? May not hordes of folk
distantly akin to the first Americans have swept across the frozen
strait, and within a few generations have made their way into the
warmer regions, as we know the Nahua did? The Scandinavian vikings who
reached north-eastern America in the tenth century found there a race
totally distinct from the Red Man, and more approaching the Esquimaux,
whom they designated Skrellingr, or &ldquo;Chips,&rdquo; so small and
misshapen were they. Such a description could hardly have been applied
to the North American Indian as we know him. From the legends of the
Red race of North America we may infer that they remained for a number
of generations in the Far West of the North American continent before
they migrated eastward. And a guess might be hazarded to the effect
that, arriving in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"
name="pb235">235</a>]</span>America somewhere about the dawn of the
Christian era, they spread slowly in a south-easterly direction,
arriving in the eastern parts of North America about the end of the
eleventh century, or even a little later. This would mean that such a
legend as that which we have just perused would only require to have
survived a thousand years, provided the <i>Popol Vuh</i> was first
composed about the eleventh century, as appears probable. But such
speculations are somewhat dangerous in the face of an almost complete
lack of evidence, and must be met with the utmost caution and treated
as surmises only.</p>

mythological portion of the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, and it will be well at
this point to make some inquiries into the origin and nature of the
various gods, heroes, and similar personages who fill its pages. Before
doing so, however, let us glance at the creation-myth which we find
detailed in the first book. We can see by internal evidence that this
must be the result of the fusion of more than one creation-story. We
find in the myth that mention is made of a number of beings each of
whom appears to exercise in some manner the functions of a creator or
&ldquo;moulder.&rdquo; These beings also appear to have similar
attributes. There is evidently here the reconciliation of early rival
faiths. We know that this occurred in Peruvian cosmogony, which is
notoriously composite, and many another mythology, European and
Asiatic, exhibits a like phenomenon. Even in the creation-story as
given in Genesis we can discover the fusion of two separate accounts
from the allusion to the creative power as both &ldquo;Jahveh&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Elohim,&rdquo; the plural ending of the second name proving
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=

fix the date of its origin, even approximately. We possess only the one

The former is the male fructifier, whilst the name of the latter

it was for generations recited before being reduced to writing.
Passages here and there exhibit a decided metrical tendency, and one
undoubtedly applies to a descriptive dance symbolical of sunrise. It is
as follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Whilst dealing with Maya pseudo-history it will be
well to glance for a moment at the theories of the late Augustus Le
Plongeon, who lived and carried on excavations in Yucatan for many
years. Dr. Le Plongeon was obsessed with the idea that the ancient Maya
spread their civilisation all over the habitable globe, and that they
were the originators of the Egyptian, Palestinian, and Hindu
civilisations, besides many others. He furthermore believed himself to
be the true elucidator of the Maya system of hieroglyphs, which in his
estimation were practically identical with the Egyptian. We will not
attempt to refute his theories, as they are based on ignorance of the
laws which govern philology, anthropology, and mythology. But he
possessed a thorough knowledge of the Maya tongue, and his acquaintance
with Maya customs was extensive and peculiar. One of his ideas was that
a certain hall among the ruins of Chichen-Itza had been built by a
Queen M&oacute;o, a Maya princess who after the tragic fate of her
brother-husband and the catastrophe which ended in the sinking of the
continent of Atlantis fled to Egypt, where she founded the ancient
Egyptian civilisation. It would be easy to refute this theory. But the
tale as told by Dr. Le Plongeon possesses a sufficiency of romantic
interest to warrant its being rescued from the little-known volume in
which he published it.<a class="noteref" id="xd22e4215src" href=

Carved on the lintel are the names of these personages, represented by

by a mask representing an owl&rsquo;s head. She, pretty and coquettish,
has many admirers, who vie with each other for the honour of her hand.
In company with one of her wooers she comes to consult the priest,
accompanied by an old lady, her grandmother probably, and her female
attendants. According to custom the old lady is the spokeswoman. She
states to the priest that the young man, he who sits on a low stool
between two female attendants, desires to marry the Queen. The
priest&rsquo;s attendant, seated also on a stool, back of all, acts as
crier, and repeats in a loud voice the speech of the old lady.</p>

exalted rank is indicated by his headdress, and the triple breastplate
he wears over his mantle of feathers. The consulter, evidently a person
of importance, has come attended by his <i>hachetail</i>, or
confidential friend, who sits behind him on a cushion. The expression
on the face of the said consulter shows that he does not accept
patiently the decrees of fate, although conveyed by the interpreter in
as conciliatory a manner as possible. The adverse decision of the gods
is manifested by the sharp projecting centre part of the scroll, but it
is wrapped in words as persuasive and consoling, preceded by as smooth
a preamble as the rich and beautiful Maya language permits and makes
easy. His friend is addressing the prophet&rsquo;s assistant.
Reflecting the thoughts of his lord, he declares that the
<i>nubchi&rsquo;s</i> fine discourse and his pretended reading of the
will of the gods are all nonsense, and exclaims &lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo;

pointed at both ends, escaping from his nose like a sneeze. The answer

<p class="par first">If the civilisation of ancient Peru did not
achieve the standard of general culture reached by the Mexicans and
Maya, it did not fall far short of the attainment of these peoples. But
the degrading despotism under which the peasantry groaned in Inca
times, and the brutal and sanguinary tyranny of the Apu-Ccapac Incas,
make the rulers of Mexico at their worst appear as enlightened when
compared with the Peruvian governing classes. The Quichua-Aymara race
which inhabited Peru was inferior to the Mexican in general mental
culture, if not in mental capacity, as is proved by its inability to
invent any method of written communication or any adequate
time-reckoning. In imitative art, too, the Peruvians were weak, save in
pottery and rude modelling, and their religion savoured much more of
the materialistic, and was altogether of a lower cultus.</p>

<p class="par first">The country in which the interesting civilisation
of the Inca race was evolved presents physical features which
profoundly affected the history of the race. In fact, it is probable
that in no country in the world has the configuration of the land so
modified the events in the life of the people dwelling within its
borders. The chain of the Andes divides into two branches near the
boundary between Bolivia and Chili, and, with the Cordillera de la
Costa, encloses at a height of over 3000 feet the Desaguadero, a vast
tableland with an area equal to France. To the north of this is Cuzco,
the ancient capital of the Incas, to the south Potosi, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>the
most elevated town in the world, whilst between them lies Lake
Titicaca, the largest body of fresh water in South America. The whole
country is dreary and desolate in the extreme. Cereals cannot ripen,
and animals are rare. Yet it was in these desolate regions that the
powerful and highly organised empire of Peru arose&mdash;an empire
extending over an area 3000 miles long by 400 broad.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Andeans</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The prehistoric natives of the Andean region had
evolved a civilisation long before the days of the Inca dynasties, and
the cyclopean ruins of their edifices are to be found at intervals
scattered over a wide field on the slopes of the range under the shadow
of which they dwelt. Their most extraordinary achievement was probably
the city of Tiahuanaco, on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca, built
at a level 13,000 feet above the sea, occupying nearly half an acre in
extent, and constructed of enormous megalithic blocks of trachytic
rock. The great doorway, carved out of a single block of rock, is 7
feet in height by 13&ndash;1/2 feet wide, and 1&ndash;1/2 feet thick.
The upper portion of this massive portal is carved with symbolic
figures. In the centre is a figure in high relief, the head surrounded
by solar rays, and in each hand a sceptre, the end of which terminates
in the head of a condor. This figure is flanked on either side by three
tiers of kneeling suppliants, each of whom is winged and bears a
sceptre similar in design to the central ones. Elsewhere are mighty
blocks of stone, some 36 feet long, remains of enormous walls, standing
monoliths, and in earlier times colossal statues were seen on the site.
When the Spanish conquerors arrived no tradition remained regarding the
founders of these structures, and their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>origin still remains

<p class="par first">The greatest mystery of all regarding the ruins at
Tiahuanaco is the selection of the site. For what reason did the
prehistoric rulers of Peru build here? The surroundings are totally
unsuitable for the raising of such edifices, and the tableland upon
which they are placed is at once desolate and difficult of access. The
snow-line is contiguous, and breathing at such a height is no easy
matter. There is no reason to suppose that climatic conditions in the
day of these colossal builders were different from those which obtain
at the present time. In face of these facts the position of Tiahuanaco

<p class="par first">Other remains of these prehistoric people are
found in various parts of Peru. At Sacsahuaman, perched on a hill above
the city of Cuzco, is an immense fortified work six hundred yards long,
built in three lines of wall consisting of enormous stones, some of
which are twenty-seven feet in length. Pissac is also the site of
wonderful ruined masonry and an ancient observatory. At Ollantay-tampu,
forty-five miles to the north of Cuzco, is another of these gigantic
fortresses, built to defend the valley of the Yucay. This stronghold is
constructed for the most part of red porphyry, and its walls average
twenty-five feet in height. The great cliff on which Ollantay is
perched is covered from end to end with stupendous walls which zigzag
from point to point of it like the salient angles of some modern
fortalice. At intervals are placed round towers of stone provided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=

discharged at the enemy. This outwork embraces a series of terraces,
world-famous because of their gigantic outline and the problem of the
use to which they were put. It is now practically agreed that these
terraces were employed for the production of maize, in order that
during a prolonged investment the beleaguered troops and country-folk
might not want for a sufficiency of provender. The stone of which this
fortress was built was quarried at a distance of seven miles, in a spot
upwards of three thousand feet above the valley, and was dragged up the
steep declivity of Ollantay by sheer human strength. The nicety with
which the stones were fitted is marvellous.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Drama-Legend of Ollantay</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Among the dramatic works with which the ancient
Incas were credited is that of <i>Apu-Ollanta</i>, which may recount
the veritable story of a chieftain after whom the great stronghold was
named. It was probably divided into scenes and supplied with stage
directions at a later period, but the dialogue and songs are truly
aboriginal. The period is that of the reign of the Inca Yupanqui
Pachacutic, one of the most celebrated of the Peruvian monarchs. The
central figure of the drama is a chieftain named Ollanta, who conceived
a violent passion for a daughter of the Inca named Curi-Coyllur (Joyful
Star). This passion was deemed unlawful, as no mere subject who was not
of the blood-royal might aspire to the hand of a daughter of the Inca.
As the play opens we overhear a dialogue between Ollanta and his
man-servant Piqui-Chaqui (Flea-footed), who supplies what modern
stage-managers would designate the &ldquo;comic relief.&rdquo; They are
talking of Ollanta&rsquo;s love for the princess, when they are
confronted by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252"
name="pb252">252</a>]</span>high-priest of the Sun, who tries to
dissuade the rash chieftain from the dangerous course he is taking by
means of a miracle. In the next scene Curi-Coyllur is seen in company
with her mother, sorrowing over the absence of her lover. A harvest
song is here followed by a love ditty of undoubtedly ancient origin.
The third scene represents Ollanta&rsquo;s interview with the Inca in
which he pleads his suit and is slighted by the scornful monarch.
Ollanta defies the king in a resounding speech, with which the first
act concludes. In the first scene of the second act we are informed
that the disappointed chieftain has raised the standard of rebellion,
and the second scene is taken up with the military preparations
consequent upon the announcement of a general rising. In the third
scene Rumi-&ntilde;aui as general of the royal forces admits defeat by
the rebels.</p>

the south came a civilising race which probably found a number of
allied tribes, each existing separately in its own little valley,
speaking a different dialect, or even language, from its neighbours,
and in many instances employing different customs. Although tradition
alleged that these invaders came from the north by sea within
historical times, the more probable theory of their origin is one which
states that they had followed the course of the affluents of the Amazon
to the valleys where they dwelt when the more enlightened <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The arrival of the dominant race rudely broke in
upon the peaceful existence of the aboriginal folk. This race, the
Quichua-Aymara, probably had its place of origin in the Altaplanicie
highlands of Bolivia, the eastern cordillera of the Andes. This they
designated Tucuman (World&rsquo;s End), just as the Kiche of Guatemala
were wont to describe the land of their origin as Ki Pixab (Corner of
the Earth). The present republic of Argentina was at a remote period
covered by a vast, partially land-locked sea, and beside the shores of
this the ancestors of the Quichua-Aymara race may have settled as
fishers and fowlers. They found a more permanent settlement on the
shores of Lake Titicaca, where their traditions state that they made
considerable advances in the arts of civilisation. It was, indeed, from
Titicaca that the sun emerged from the sacred rock where he had
erstwhile hidden himself. Here, too, the llama and paco were
domesticated and agricultural life initiated, or perfected. The arts of
irrigation and terrace-building&mdash;so marked as features of Peruvian
civilisation&mdash;were also invented in this region, and the basis of
a composite advancement laid.</p>

respectively. These possess a common <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

structure, and a great number of words are common to both. They are in
reality varying forms of one speech. From the valley of Titicaca the
Aymara spread from the source of the Amazon river to the higher parts
of the Andes range, so that in course of time they exhibited those
qualities which stamp the mountaineer in every age and clime. The
Quichua, on the other hand, occupied the warm valleys beyond the river
Apurimac, to the north-west of the Aymara-speaking people&mdash;a tract
equal to the central portion of the modern republic of Peru. The name
&ldquo;Quichua&rdquo; implies a warm valley or sphere, in
contradistinction to the &ldquo;Yunca,&rdquo; or tropical districts of
the coast and lowlands.</p>

of the <i>monta&ntilde;a</i> region. The Inca people, coming suddenly
into these lands, annexed them with surprising rapidity, and, making
the aboriginal tribes dependent upon their rule, spread themselves over
the face of the country. Thus the ancient chroniclers. But it is
obvious that such rapid conquest was a practical impossibility, and it
is now understood that the Inca power was consolidated only some
hundred years before the coming of Pizarro.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Coming of Manco Ccapac</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Peruvian myth has its Quetzalcoatl in Manco
Ccapac, a veritable son of the sun. The Life-giver, observing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>the deplorable condition of mankind, who seemed
to exist for war and feasting alone, despatched his son, Manco Ccapac,
and his sister-wife, Mama Oullo Huaca, to earth for the purpose of
instructing the degraded peoples in the arts of civilised life. The
heavenly pair came to earth in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca, and
were provided with a golden wedge which they were assured would sink
into the earth at the precise spot on which they should commence their
missionary labours. This phenomenon occurred at Cuzco, where the wedge
disappeared. The derivation of the name Cuzco, which means
&ldquo;Navel,&rdquo; or, in more modern terms, &ldquo;Hub of the
Universe,&rdquo; proves that it was regarded as a great culture-centre.
On this spot the civilising agents pitched their camp, gathering the
uncultured folk of the country around them. Whilst Manco taught the men
the arts of agriculture, Mama Oullo instructed the women in those of
weaving and spinning. Great numbers gathered in the vicinity of Cuzco,
and the foundations of a city were laid. Under the mild rule of the
heavenly pair the land of Peru abounded in every desirable thing, like
the Eden of Genesis. The legend of Manco Ccapac as we have it from an
old Spanish source is worth giving. It is as follows: &ldquo;There [in
Tiahuanaco] the creator began to raise up the people and nations that
are in that region, making one of each nation in clay, and painting the
dresses that each one was to wear; those that were to wear their hair,
with hair, and those that were to be shorn, with hair cut. And to each
nation was given the language that was to be spoken, and the songs to
be sung, and the seeds and food that they were to sow. When the creator
had finished painting and making the said nations and figures of clay,
he gave life and soul to each one, as well man as woman, and ordered
that they should pass under the earth. Thence each nation came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>up in the places to which he ordered them to go.
Thus they say that some came out of caves, others issued from hills,
others from fountains, others from the trunks of trees. From this cause
and others, and owing to having come forth and multiplied from those
places, and to having had the beginning of their lineage in them, they
made <i>huacas</i><a class="noteref" id="xd22e4498src" href=
"#xd22e4498" name="xd22e4498src">1</a> and places of worship of them,
in memory of the origin of their lineage. Thus each nation uses the
dress with which they invest their <i>huaca</i>; and they say that the
first that was born in that place was there turned into stone. Others
say that they were turned into falcons, condors, and other animals and
birds. Hence the <i>huacas</i> they use are in different
shapes.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Peruvian Creation-Story</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Incan Peruvians believed that all things
emanated from Pachacamac, the all-pervading spirit, who provided the
plants and animals (which they believed to be produced from the earth)
with &ldquo;souls.&rdquo; The earth itself they designated Pachacamama
(Earth-Mother). Here we observe that Pachacamac was more the maker and
moulder than the originator of matter, a view common to many American
mythologies. Pachacamac it was who breathed the breath of life into
man, but the Peruvian conception of him was only evolved in later Inca
times, and by no means existed in the early days of Inca rule, although
he was probably worshipped before this under another and less exalted
shape. The mere exercise of will or thought was sufficient, according
to the Peruvians, to accomplish the creative act. In the prayers to the
creator, and in other portions of Inca rite, we read such expressions
as &ldquo;Let a man be,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let a woman be,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The creative word,&rdquo; which go to prove that the Peruvian
consciousness had fully <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>grasped the idea of a creator
capable of evolving matter out of nothingness. Occasionally we find the
sun acting as a kind of demiurge or sub-creator. He it is who in later
legend founds the city of Cuzco, and sends thither three eggs composed
of gold, silver, and copper, from which spring the three classes of
Peruvians, kings, priests, and slaves. The inevitable deluge occurs,
after which we find the prehistoric town of Tiahuanaco regarded as the
theatre of a new creation of man. Here the creator made man, and
separated him into nations, making one of each nation out of the clay
of the earth, painting the dresses that each was to wear, and endowing
them with national songs, languages, seeds to sow suitable to the
environment of each, and food such as they would require. Then he gave
the peoples life and soul, and commanded them to enter the bowels of
the earth, whence they came upward in the places where he ordered them
to go. Perhaps this is one of the most complete
(&ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; would be a better word) creation-myths in
existence, and we can glean from its very completeness that it is by no
means of simple origin, but of great complexity. It is obviously an
attempt to harmonise several conflicting creation-stories, notably
those in which the people are spoken of as emanating from caves, and
the later one of the creation of men at Tiahuanaco, probably suggested
to the Incas by the immense ruins at that place, for which they could
not otherwise account.</p>

Irma Pachacamac was not considered to be the creator of the sun, but to
be himself a descendant of it. The first human beings created by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=

hunger, but the woman supported herself by living on roots. The sun
took compassion upon her and gave her a son, whom Pachacamac slew and
buried. But from his teeth there grew maize, from his ribs the long
white roots of the manioc plant, and from his flesh various esculent
plants.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Apart from the treatment which they meted out to
the subject races under their sway, the rule of the Inca monarchs was
enlightened and contained the elements of high civilisation. It is
scarcely clear whether the Inca race arrived in the country at such a
date as would have permitted them to profit by adopting the arts and
sciences of the Andean people who preceded them. But it may be affirmed
that their arrival considerably post-dated the fall of the megalithic
empire of the Andeans, so that in reality their civilisation was of
their own manufacture. As architects they were by no means the
inferiors of the prehistoric race, if the examples of their art did not
bulk so massively, and the engineering skill with which they pushed
long, straight tunnels through vast mountains and bridged seemingly
impassable gorges still excites the wonder of modern experts. They also
made long, straight roads after the most improved macadamised model.
Their temples and palaces were adorned with gold and silver images and
ornaments; sumptuous baths supplied with hot and cold water by means of
pipes laid in the earth were to be found in the mansions of the
nobility, and much luxury and real comfort prevailed.</p>

<h3 class="main">An Absolute Theocracy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The empire of Peru was the most absolute theocracy
the world has ever seen. The Inca was the direct <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>representative of the sun upon earth, the head
of a socio-religious edifice intricate and highly organised. This
colossal bureaucracy had ramifications into the very homes of the
people. The Inca was represented in the provinces by governors of the
blood-royal. Officials were placed above ten thousand families, a
thousand families, and even ten families, upon the principle that the
rays of the sun enter everywhere, and that therefore the light of the
Inca must penetrate to every corner of the empire. There was no such
thing as personal freedom. Every man, woman, and child was numbered,
branded, and under surveillance as much as were the llamas in the royal
herds. Individual effort or enterprise was unheard of. Some writers
have stated that a system of state socialism obtained in Peru. If so,
then state surveillance in Central Russia might also be branded as
socialism. A man&rsquo;s life was planned for him by the authorities
from the age of five years, and even the woman whom he was to marry was
selected for him by the Government officials. The age at which the
people should marry was fixed at not earlier than twenty-four years for
a man and eighteen for a woman. Coloured ribbons worn round the head
indicated the place of a person&rsquo;s birth or the province to which
he belonged.</p>

<h3 class="main">A Golden Temple</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the most remarkable monuments of the
Peruvian civilisation was the Coricancha (Town of Gold) at Cuzco, the
principal fane of the sun-god. Its inner and outer walls were covered
with plates of pure gold. Situated upon an eminence eighty feet high,
the temple looked down upon gardens filled, according to the conquering
Spaniards, with treasures of gold and silver. The animals, insects, the
very trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>say the chroniclers, were of the precious
metals, as were the spades, hoes, and other implements employed for
keeping the ground in cultivation. Through the pleasances rippled the
river Huatenay. Such was the glittering Intipampa (Field of the Sun).
That the story is true, at least in part, is proved by the traveller
Squier, who speaks of having seen in several houses in Cuzco sheets of
gold preserved as relics which came from the Temple of the Sun. These,
he says, were scarcely as thick as paper, and were stripped off the
walls of the Coricancha by the exultant Spanish soldiery.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">But this house of gold had but a roof of thatch!
The Peruvians were ignorant of the principle of the arch, or else
considered the feature unsuitable, for some reason best known to their
architects. The doorways were formed of huge monoliths, and the entire
aspect of the building was cyclopean. The interior displayed an ornate
richness which impressed even the Spaniards, who had seen the wealth of
many lands and Oriental kingdoms, and the gold-lust must have swelled
within their hearts at sight of the great altar, behind which was a
huge plate of the shining metal engraved with the features of the
sun-god. The surface of this plate was enriched by a thousand gems, the
scintillation of which was, according to eye-witnesses, almost
insupportable. Around this dazzling sphere were seated the mummified
corpses of the Inca kings, each on his throne, with sceptre in
hand.</p>

<h3 class="main">Planetary Temples</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Surrounding the Coricancha several lesser temples
clustered, all of them dedicated to one or other of the planetary
bodies&mdash;to the moon, to Cuycha, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>rainbow, to Chasca,
the planet Venus. In the temple of the moon, the mythic mother of the
Inca dynasty, a great plate of silver, like the golden one which
represented the face of the sun-god, depicted the features of the
moon-goddess, and around this the mummies of the Inca queens sat in a
semicircle, like their spouses in the greater neighbouring fane. In the
rainbow temple of Cuycha the seven-hued arch of heaven was depicted by
a great arc of gold skilfully tempered or painted in suitable colours.
All the utensils in these temples were of gold or silver. In the
principal building twelve large jars of silver held the sacred grain,
and even the pipes which conducted the water-supply through the earth
to the sanctuary were of silver. Pedro Pizarro himself, besides other
credible eye-witnesses, vouched for these facts. The colossal
representation of the sun became the property of a certain Mancio Serra
de Leguicano, a reckless cavalier and noted gambler, who lost it on a
single throw of the dice! Such was the spirit of the adventurers who
conquered this golden realm for the crown of Spain. The walls of the
Coricancha are still standing, and this marvellous shrine of the chief
luminary of heaven, the great god of the Peruvians, is now a Christian
church.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mummies of Peru</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The fact that the ancient Peruvians had a method
of mummification has tempted many &ldquo;antiquarians&rdquo; to infer
therefrom that they had some connection with ancient Egypt. These
theories are so numerous as to give the unsophisticated reader the idea
that a regular system of immigration was carried on between Egypt and
America. As a matter of fact the method of mummification in vogue in
Peru was entirely different from that employed by the ancient
Egyptians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>Peruvian mummies are met with at apparently all
stages of the history of the native races. Megalithic tombs and
monuments contain them in the doubled-up posture so common among early
peoples all over the world. These megalithic tombs, or <i>chulpas</i>,
as they are termed, are composed of a mass of rough stones and clay,
faced with huge blocks of trachyte or basalt, so put together as to
form a cist, in which the mummy was placed. The door invariably faces
the east, so that it may catch the gleams of the rising sun&mdash;a
proof of the prevalence of sun-worship. Squier alludes to one more than
24 feet high. An opening 18 inches square gave access to the sepulchral
chamber, which was 11 feet square by 13 feet high. But the tomb had
been entered before, and after getting in with much difficulty the
explorer was forced to retreat empty-handed.</p>
<p class="par">Many of these <i>chulpas</i> are circular, and painted
in gay primary colours. They are very numerous in Bolivia, an old
Peruvian province, and in the basin of Lake Titicaca they abound. The
dead were wrapped in llama-skins, on which the outlines of the eyes and
mouth were carefully marked. The corpse was then arrayed in other
garments, and the door of the tomb walled up. In some parts of Peru the
dead were mummified and placed in the dwelling-houses beside the
living. In the rarefied air of the plateaus the bodies rapidly became
innocuous, and the custom was not the insanitary one we might imagine
it to be.</p>
<p class="par">On the Pacific coast the method of mummification was
somewhat different. The body was reduced to a complete state of
desiccation, and was deposited in a tomb constructed of stone or adobe.
Vases intended to hold maize or <i>chicha</i> liquor were placed beside
the corpse, and copper hatchets, mirrors of polished stone,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>earrings, and bracelets have been discovered in
these burial-places. Some of the remains are wrapped in rich cloth, and
vases of gold and silver were placed beside them. Golden plaques are
often discovered in the mouths, probably symbolic of the sun. The
bodies exhibit no traces of embalming, and are usually in a sitting
posture. Some of them have evidently been dried before inhumation,
whilst others are covered with a resinous substance. They are generally
accompanied by the various articles used during life; the men have
their weapons and ornaments, women their household implements, and
children their toys. The dryness of the climate, as in Egypt, keeps
these relics in a wonderful state of preservation. In the grave of a
woman were found not only vases of every shape, but also some cloth she
had commenced to weave, which her death had perhaps prevented her from
completing. Her light brown hair was carefully combed and plaited, and
the legs from the ankle to the knee were painted red, after the fashion
in vogue among Peruvian beauties, while little bladders of
toilet-powder and gums were thoughtfully placed beside her for her use
in the life to come.</p>

<h3 class="main">Laws and Customs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The legal code of the Incas was severe in the
extreme. Murderers and adulterers were punished by death, and the
unpardonable sin appears to have been blasphemy against the sun, or his
earthly representative, the Inca. The Virgin of the Sun (or nun) who
broke her vow was buried alive, and the village from whence she came
was razed to the ground. Flogging was administered for minor offences.
A peculiar and very trying punishment must have been that of carrying a
heavy stone for a certain time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265"
href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On marriage a home was apportioned to each couple, and
land assigned to them sufficient for their support. When a child was
born a separate allowance was given it&mdash;one <i>fanega</i> for a
boy, and half that amount for a girl, the <i>fanega</i> being equal to
the area which could be sown with a hundred pounds of maize. There is
something repulsive in the Inca code, with its grandmotherly
legislation; and if this tyranny was beneficent, it was devised merely
to serve its own ends and hound on the unhappy people under its control
like dumb, driven cattle. The outlook of the average native was limited
in the extreme. The Inca class of priests and warriors retained every
vestige of authority; and that they employed their power unmercifully
to grind down the millions beneath them was a sufficient excuse for the
Spanish Conquistadores in dispossessing them of the empire they had so
harshly administered.</p>
<p class="par">The public ground was divided afresh every year
according to the number of the members of each family, and agrarian
laws were strictly fixed. Private property did not exist among the
people of the lower classes, who merely farmed the lot which each year
was placed at their disposal. Besides this, the people had perforce to
cultivate the lands sacred to the Inca, and only the aged and the sick
could evade this duty.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Peruvian Calendar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The standard chronology known to the Peru of the
Incas was a simple lunar reckoning. But the four principal points in
the sun&rsquo;s course were denoted by means of the <i>intihuatana</i>,
a device consisting of a large rock surmounted by a small cone, the
shadow of which, falling on certain notches on the stone below, marked
the date of the great sun-festivals. The Peruvians, however, had no
definite calendar. At Cuzco, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>capital, the solstices were
gauged by pillars called <i>pachacta unanchac</i>, or indicators of
time, which were placed in four groups (two pillars to a group) on
promontories, two in the direction of sunrise and two in that of
sunset, to mark the extreme points of the sun&rsquo;s rising and
setting. By this means they were enabled to distinguish the arrival and
departure of the solstices, during which the sun never went beyond the
middle pair of pillars. The Inca astronomer&rsquo;s approximation to
the year was 360 days, which were divided into twelve moons of thirty
days each. These moons were not calendar months in the correct sense,
but simply a succession of lunations, which commenced with the winter
solstice. This method, which must ultimately have proved confusing,
does not seem to have been altered to co-ordinate with the reckoning of
the succession of years. The names of the twelve moons, which had some
reference to the daily life of the Peruvian, were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huchuy Pucuy Quilla (Small Growing Moon), approximately
January.</li>
<li>Hatun Pucuy Quilla (Great Growing Moon), approximately
February.</li>
<li>Pancar Pucuy Quilla (Flower-growing Moon), approximately
March.</li>
<li>Ayrihua Quilla (Twin Ears Moon), approximately April.</li>
<li>Aymuray Quilla (Harvest Moon), approximately May.</li>
<li>Auray Cusqui Quilla (Breaking Soil), approximately June.</li>
<li>Chahua Huarqui Quilla (Irrigation Moon), approximately July.</li>
<li>Tarpuy Quilla (Sowing Moon), approximately August.</li>

<h3 class="main">The Festivals</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That the Peruvian standard of time, as with all
American people, was taken from the natural course of the moon is known
chiefly from the fact that the principal religious festivals began on
the new moon following a solstice or equinox. The ceremonies connected
with the greatest festival, the Ccapac Raymi, were made to date near
the lunar phases, the two stages commencing with the ninth day of the
December moon and twenty-first day, or last quarter. But while these
lunar phases indicated certain festivals, it very often happened that
the civil authorities followed a reckoning of their own, in preference
to accepting ecclesiastical rule. Considerable significance was
attached to each month by the Peruvians regarding the nature of their
festivals. The solstices and equinoxes were the occasions of
established ceremonies. The arrival of the winter solstice, which in
Peru occurs in June, was celebrated by the Intip Raymi (Great Feast of
the Sun). The principal Peruvian feast, which took place at the summer
solstice, when the new year was supposed to begin, was the national
feast of the great god Pachacamac, and was called Ccapac Raymi. Molina,
Fernandez, and Garcilasso, however, date the new year from the winter
solstice. The third festival of the Inca year, the Ccapac Sit&#365;a,
or Ccoya Raymi (Moon Feast), which is signalled by the beginning of the
rainy season, occurred in September. In general character these
festivals appear to have been simple, and even childlike. The sacrifice
of animals taken from sacred herds of llamas was doubtless a principal
feature of the ceremony, accompanied by the offering up of
<i>maguey</i>, or maize spirit, and followed by the performance of
symbolic dances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268"

<h3 class="main">The Llama</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The llama was the chief domestic animal of Peru.
All llamas were the property of the Inca. Like the camel, its distant
relative, this creature can subsist for long periods upon little
nourishment, and it is suitable for the carriage of moderate loads.
Each year a certain amount of llama wool was given to the Peruvian
family, according to the number of women it contained, and these wove
it into garments, whatever was over being stored away in the public
cloth-magazines for the general use. The large flocks of llamas and
alpacas also afforded a supply of meat for the people such as the
Mexicans never possessed. Naturally much attention was given to the
breeding of these animals, and the alpaca was as carefully regarded by
the Peruvian as the sheep by the farmer of to-day. The guanacos and
vicu&ntilde;as, wild animals of the llama or auchenia family, were also
sources of food- and wool-supply.</p>

<h3 class="main">Architecture of the Incas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The art in which the Incan Peruvians displayed the
greatest advance was that of architecture. The earlier style of Inca
building shows that it was closely modelled, as has already been
pointed out, on that of the megalithic masons of the Tiahuanaco
district, but the later style shows stones laid in regular courses,
varying in length. No cement or mortar of any kind was employed, the
structure depending for stability upon the accuracy with which the
stones were fitted to each other. An enormous amount of labour must
have been expended upon this part of the work, for in the monuments of
Peruvian architecture which still exist it is impossible to insert even
a needle between the stones of which they are composed. The palaces
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>and temples were built around a courtyard, and
most of the principal buildings had a hall of considerable dimensions
attached to them, which, like the baronial halls of the England of the
Middle Ages, served for feasting or ceremony. In this style is built
the front of the palace on the Colcampata, overlooking the city of
Cuzco, under the fortress which is supposed to have been the dwelling
of Manco Ccapac, the first Inca. Palaces at Yucay and Chinchero are
also of this type.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In an illuminating passage upon Inca architecture
Sir Clements Markham, the greatest living authority upon matters
Peruvian, says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In Cuzco the stone used is a dark trachyte, and
the coarse grain secured greater adhesion between the blocks. The
workmanship is unsurpassed, and the world has nothing to show in the
way of stone-cutting and fitting to equal the skill and accuracy
displayed in the Ynca structures of Cuzco. No cement is used, and the
larger stones are in the lowest row, each ascending course being
narrower, which presents a most pleasing effect. The edifices were
built round a court, upon which the rooms opened, and some of the great
halls were 200 paces long by 60 wide, the height being 35 to 40 feet,
besides the spring of the roof. The roofs were thatch; and we are able
to form an idea of their construction from one which is still
preserved, after a lapse of three centuries. This is on a circular
building called the Sondor-huasi, at Azangaro, and it shows that even
thatch in the hands of tasteful builders will make a sightly roof for
imposing edifices, and that the interior ornament of such a roof may be
exceedingly beautiful.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"

sacred building in Peru. Its ruins consist of a wall of adobe or clay
40 feet high and 330 long, built on stone foundations 8 feet in height.
The roof was supported on twenty-five columns, and the width of the
structure was 87 feet. It was a place of pilgrimage, and the
caravanserais where the Faithful were wont to be housed still stand

was Titicaca, an island on the lake of that name. The island of Coati,
hard by, enjoyed an equal reverence. Terraced platforms on the former,
reached by flights of steps, support two buildings provided for the use
of pilgrims about to proceed to Coati. On Titicaca there are the ruins
of an extensive palace which commands a splendid view of the
surrounding barren country. A great bath or tank is situated half-way
down a long range of terraces supported by cut stone masonry, and the
pool, 40 feet long by 10, and 5 feet deep, has similar walls on three
sides. Below this tank the water is made to irrigate terrace after
terrace until it falls into the lake.</p>

The principal building is on one of the loftiest of seven terraces,
once radiant with flowers and shrubs, and filled with rich loam
transported from a more fertile region. It is placed on three sides of
a square, 183 feet long by 80, and is of stone laid in clay and coated

Markham, &ldquo;thirty-five chambers, only one of which is faced with
hewn stones. The ornament on the fa&ccedil;ade consists of elaborate
niches, which agreeably break the monotony of the wall, and above them
runs a projecting cornice. The walls were painted yellow, and the
niches red; and there was a high-pitched roof, broken here and there by
gables. The two largest chambers are 20 long by 12, and loftier than
the rest, each with a great niche in the wall facing the entrance.
These were probably the holy places or shrines of the temple. The
beautiful series of terraces falls off from the esplanade of the temple
to the shores of the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">The coast folk, of a different race from the
Incas, had their centre of civilisation near the city of Truxillo, on
the plain of Chimu. Here the ruins of a great city litter the plain for
many acres. Arising from the mass of ruin, at intervals stand
<i>huacas</i>, or artificial hills. The city was supplied with water by
means of small canals, which also served to irrigate the gardens. The
mounds alluded to were used for sepulture, and the largest, at Moche,
is 800 feet long by 470 feet in breadth, and 200 feet in height. It is
constructed of adobes. Besides serving the purpose of a cemetery, this
mound probably supported a large temple on its summit.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Palace</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A vast palace occupied a commanding position. Its
great hall was 100 feet long by 52 broad, and its walls were covered
with a highly ornate series of arabesques in relief done in stucco,
like the fretwork on the walls of Palenque. Another hall close at hand
is ornamented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>in coloured stucco, and from it branch off many
small rooms, which were evidently dormitories. From the first hall a
long corridor leads to secret storehouses, where many vessels of gold
and silver have been discovered hidden away, as if to secure them
either from marauding bands or the gaze of the vulgar. All of these
structures are hollowed out of a vast mound covering several acres, so
that the entire building may be said to be partially subterranean in
character. &ldquo;About a hundred yards to the westward of this palace
there was a sepulchral mound where many relics were discovered. The
bodies were wrapped in cloths, woven in ornamental figures and patterns
of different colours. On some of the cloths were sewn plates of silver,
and they were edged with borders of feathers, the silver being
occasionally cut in the shape of fishes. Among the ruins of the city
there are great rectangular areas enclosed by massive walls, and
containing courts, streets, dwellings, and reservoirs for water. The
largest is about a mile south of the mound-palace, and is 550 yards
long by 400. The outer wall is about 30 feet high, 10 feet thick at the
base, with sides inclining toward each other. Some of the interior
walls are highly ornamented in stuccoed patterns; and in one part there
is an edifice containing forty-five chambers or cells, in five rows of
nine each, which is supposed to have been a prison. The enclosure also
contained a reservoir 450 feet long by 195 broad, and 60 feet
deep.&rdquo;</p>

the Incas cut deep trenches to reinforce the irrigating power of a

order that the rainfall coming therefrom might be conducted into the
needful channel. Lower down the valley the main watercourse is
deflected into many branches, which irrigate each estate by feeding the
small surface streams. This system adequately serves the fifteen
estates of Nasca to-day! Another high-level canal for the irrigation of
pasture-lands was led for more than a hundred and fifty miles along the
eastern slope of the central cordillera.</p>

<h3 class="main">A Singular Discovery</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In Peru, as in Mexico, it is probable that the
cross was employed as a symbol of the four winds. An account of the
expedition of Fuentes to the valley of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>Chichas recounts the
discovery of a wooden cross as follows:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd22e4727src" href="#xd22e4727" name="xd22e4727src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the settlers who accompanied Fuentes in his
glorious expedition approached the valley they found a wooden cross,
hidden, as if purposely, in the most intricate part of the mountains.
As there is not anything more flattering to the vanity of a credulous
man than to be enabled to bring forward his testimony in the relation
of a prodigy, the devotion of these good conquerors was kindled to such
a degree by the discovery of this sacred memorial that they instantly
hailed it as miraculous and divine. They accordingly carried it in
procession to the town, and placed it in the church belonging to the
convent of San Francisco, where it is still worshipped. It appears next
to impossible that there should not, at that time, have been any
individual among them sufficiently enlightened to combat such a
persuasion, since, in reality, there was nothing miraculous in the
finding of this cross, there having been other Christian settlers,
before the arrival of Fuentes, in the same valley. The opinion,
notwithstanding, that the discovery was altogether miraculous, instead
of having been abandoned at the commencement, was confirmed still more
and more with the progress of time. The Jesuits Antonio Ruiz and Pedro
Lozano, in their respective histories of the missions of Paraguay,
&amp;c., undertook to demonstrate that the Apostle St. Thomas had been
in America. This thesis, which was so novel, and so well calculated to
draw the public attention, required, more than any other, the aid of
the most powerful reasons, and of the most irrefragable documents, to
be able to maintain itself, even in an hypothetical sense; but nothing
of all this was brought forward. Certain miserable conjectures,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>prepossession, and personal interest, supplied
the place of truth and criticism. The form of a human foot, which they
fancied they saw imprinted on the rock, and the different fables of
this description invented by ignorance at every step, were the sole
foundations on which all the relations on this subject were made to
repose. The one touching the peregrinations of St. Thomas from Brazil
to Quito must be deemed apocryphal, when it is considered that the
above reverend fathers describe the Apostle with the staff in the hand,
the black cassock girt about the waist, and all the other trappings
which distinguish the missionaries of the society. The credit which
these histories obtained at the commencement was equal to that bestowed
on the cross of Tarija, which remained in the predicament of being the
one St. Thomas had planted in person, in the continent of
America.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Chibchas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A people called the Chibchas dwelt at a very high
point of the Andes range. They were brave and industrious, and
possessed a culture of their own. They defended themselves against much
stronger native races, but after the Spanish conquest their country was
included in New Granada, and is now part of the United States of
Colombia. Less experienced than the Peruvians or Aztecs, they could,
however, weave and dye, carve and engrave, make roads, build temples,
and work in stone, wood, and metals. They also worked in pottery and
jewellery, making silver pendants and collars of shells and collars of
precious stones. They were a wealthy folk, and their Spanish conquerors
obtained much spoil. Little is known concerning them or their language,
and there is not much of interest in the traditions relating to them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>Their mythology was simple. They believed the
moon was the wife of Bochica, who represented the sun, and as she tried
to destroy men Bochica only allowed her to give light during the night.
When the aborigines were in a condition of barbarism Bochica taught
them and civilised them. The legends about Bochica resemble in many
points those about Quetzalcoatl or Manco Ccapac, as well as those
relating to the founder of Buddhism and the first Inca of Peru. The
Chibchas offered human sacrifices to their gods at certain intervals,
and kept the wretched victim for some years in preparation for his
doom. They venerated greatly the Lake of Quatavita, and are supposed to
have flung their treasures into it when they were conquered. Although
many attempts have been made to recover these, little of value has been
found.</p>
<p class="par">The Chibchas appear to have given allegiance to two
leaders, one the Zippa, who lived at Bogota, the other the Zoque, who
lived at Hunsa, now Tunja. These chiefs ruled supreme. Like the Incas,
they could only have one lawful wife, and their sons did not succeed
them&mdash;their power passed, as in some Central African tribes, to
the eldest son of the sister.</p>
<p class="par">When the Zippa died, sweet-smelling resin took the place
of his internal parts, and the body was put in a wooden coffin, with
sheets of gold for ornamentation. The coffin was hidden in an unknown
sepulchre, and these tombs have never been discovered&mdash;at least,
so say the Spaniards. Their weapons, garments, objects of daily use,
even jars of <i>chicha</i>, were buried with these chiefs. It is very
likely that a cave where rows of mummies richly dressed were found, and
many jewels, was the secret burying-place of the Zippas and the Zoques.
To these folk death meant only a continuation of the life on earth.

<h3 class="main">A Severe Legal Code</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The laws of the Chibchas were severe&mdash;death
was meted out to the murderer, and bodily punishment for stealing. A
coward was made to look like a woman and do her work, while to an
unfaithful wife was administered a dose of red pepper, which, if
swallowed, released the culprit from the penalty of death and entitled
her to an apology from her husband. The Chibchas made no use of cattle,
and lived on honey. Their houses were built of clay, and were set in
the midst of an enclosure guarded by watch-towers. The roofs were of a
conical shape, covered with reed mats, and skilfully interlaced rushes
were used to close the openings.</p>
<p class="par">The Chibchas were skilful in working bronze, lead,
copper, tin, gold, and silver, but not iron. The Saint-Germain Museum
has many specimens of gold and silver articles made by these people. M.
Uricaechea has still more uncommon specimens in his collection, such as
two golden masks of the human face larger than life, and a great number
of statuettes of men, and images of monkeys and frogs.</p>
<p class="par">The Chibchas traded with what they made, exporting the
rock salt they found in their own country and receiving in exchange
cereals with which to cultivate their own poor soil. They also made
curious little ornaments which might have passed for money, but they
are not supposed to have understood coinage. They had few stone
columns&mdash;only large granite rocks covered with huge figures of
tigers and crocodiles. Humboldt mentions these, and two very high
columns, covered with sculpture, at the junction of the Carare and
Magdalena, greatly revered by the natives, were raised probably by the
Chibchas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

unacquainted with any system of writing or numeration. The only means
of recording events they possessed was that provided by <i>quipos</i>,
knotted pieces of string or hide of varying length and colour.
According to the length or colour of these cords the significance of
the record varied; it was sometimes historical and sometimes
mathematical. <i>Quipos</i> relating to the history of the Incas were
carefully preserved by an officer called Quipo Camayol&mdash;literally,
&ldquo;The Guardian of the <i>Quipos</i>.&rdquo; The greater number
were destroyed as monuments of idolatry by the fanatical Spanish monks
who came over with the Conquistadores, but their loss is by no means
important, as no study, however profound, could possibly unriddle the
system upon which they were based. The Peruvians, however, long
continued to use them in secret.</p>

<h3 class="main">Practical Use of the Quipos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Marquis de Nadaillac has placed on record a
use to which the <i>quipos</i> were put in more modern times. He says:
&ldquo;A great revolt against the Spaniards was organised in 1792. As
was found out later, the revolt had been organised by means of
messengers carrying a piece of wood in which were enclosed threads the
ends of which were formed of red, black, blue, or white fringes. The
black thread had four knots, which signified that the messenger had
started from Vladura, the residence of the chief of the conspiracy,
four days after full moon. The white thread had ten knots, which
signified that the revolt would break out ten days after the arrival of
the messenger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>The person to whom the keeper was sent had in
his turn to make a knot in the red thread if he agreed to join the
confederates; in the red and blue threads, on the contrary, if he
refused.&rdquo; It was by means of these <i>quipos</i> that the Incas
transmitted their instructions. On all the roads starting from the
capital, at distances rarely exceeding five miles, rose <i>tambos</i>,
or stations for the <i>chasquis</i> or couriers, who went from one post
to another. The orders of the Inca thus became disseminated with great
rapidity. Orders which emanated directly from the sovereign were marked
with a red thread of the royal <i>llantu</i> (mantle), and nothing, as
historians assure us, could equal the respect with which these messages
were received.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Incas as Craftsmen</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Incan Peruvians had made some progress in the
metallurgic, ceramic, and textile arts. By washing the sands of the
rivers of Caravaya they obtained large quantities of gold, and they
extracted silver from the ore by means of blast-furnaces. Copper also
was abundant, and was employed to manufacture bronze, of which most of
their implements were made. Although it is difficult to know at what
period their mining operations were carried on, it is evident that they
could only have learned the art through long experience. Many proofs
are to be found of their skill in jewellery, and amongst these are
wonderful statuettes which they made from an amalgam of gold and
mercury, afterwards exposed to great heat. A number of curious little
ornaments made of various substances, with a little hole bored through
them, were frequently found under the <i>huacas</i>&mdash;probably
talismans. The finest handiwork of the Incas was undoubtedly in
jewellery; but unfortunately most of the examples <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>of
their work in this craft were melted down to assuage the insatiable
avarice of the Spanish conquerors, and are therefore for ever lost to
us. The spade and chisel employed in olden times by the Peruvians are
much the same as the people use now, but some of their tools were
clumsy. Their javelins, tomahawks, and other military arms were very
futile weapons. Some found near the mines of Pasco were made of
stone.</p>
<p class="par">The spinning, weaving, and dyeing of the Peruvians were
unequalled in aboriginal America, their cloths and tapestries being
both graceful in design and strong in texture.</p>
<p class="par">Stamps of bark or earthenware were employed to fix
designs upon their woollen stuffs, and feathers were added to the
garments made from these, the combination producing a gay effect much
admired by the Spaniards. The British Museum possesses some good

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Peruvians excelled in the potter&rsquo;s art.
The pottery was baked in a kiln, and was varied in colour, red, black,
and grey being the favourite shades. It was varnished outside, and the
vases were moulded in two pieces and joined before heating. Much of the
work is of great grace and elegance, and the shapes of animals were
very skilfully imitated. Many drinking-cups of elegant design have been
discovered, and some vases are of considerable size, measuring over
three feet in height. A simple geometric pattern is usually employed
for decoration, but sometimes rows of birds and insects figure in the
ceramics. The pottery of the coast people is more rich and varied than
that of the Inca race proper, and among its types we find vases moulded
in the form of human faces, many of them exhibiting so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>much
character that we are forced to conclude that they are veritable
portraits. Fine stone dishes are often found, as well as platters of
wood, and these frequently bear as ornament tasteful carvings
representing serpents. On several cups and vases are painted
representations of battles between the Inca forces and the savages of
the eastern forests using bows and arrows; below wander the animals of
the forest region, a brightly painted group.</p>
<p class="par">The Arch&aelig;ological Museum of Madrid gives a
representation of very varied kinds of Peruvian pottery, including some
specimens modelled upon a series of plants, interesting to botanists.
The Louvre collections have one or two interesting examples of
earthenware, as well as the Ethnographical Museum of St. Petersburg,
and in all these collections there are types which are believed to be
peculiar to the Old World.</p>
<p class="par">The Trocadero Museum has a very curious specimen with
two necks called the &ldquo;Salvador.&rdquo; A drawing on the vase
represents a man with a tomahawk. The Peruvians, like the Mexicans,
also made musical instruments out of earthenware, and heavy ornaments,
principally for the ear.</p>

<h3 class="main">Historical Sketch of the Incan Peruvians</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Inca dominion, as the Spaniards found it, was
instituted only about a century before the coming of the white man.
Before that time Inca sway held good over scattered portions of the
country, but had not extended over the entire territory which in later
times was connected with the Inca name. That it was founded on the
wreck of a more ancient power which once existed in the district of
Chinchay-suyu there can be little doubt. This power was wielded over a
space bounded by the lake of Chinchay-cocha on the north and Abancay on
the south, and extended to the Pacific <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>at the valley of
Chincha. It was constituted by an alliance of tribes under the
leadership of the chief of Pucara, in the Huanca country. A branch of
this confederacy, the Chanca, pushing southward in a general movement,
encountered the Inca people of Colla-suyu, who, under their leader,
Pachacutic, a young but determined chieftain, defeated the invaders in
a decisive battle near Cuzco. In consequence of this defeat the Chanca
deserted their former allies and made common cause with their victors.
Together the armies made a determined attack on the Huanca alliance,
which they broke up, and conquered the northern districts of the
Chinchay-suyu. Thus Central Peru fell to the Inca arms.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Inca history, or rather tradition, as we must call
it in the light of an unparalleled lack of original documentary
evidence, spoke of a series of eleven monarchs from Manco Ccapac to
Huaina Ccapac, who died shortly before the Spanish conquest. These had
reigned for a collective period of nearly 350 years. The evidence that
these chiefs had reigned was of the best, for their mummified bodies
were preserved in the great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, already
described. There they received the same daily service as when in the
flesh. Their private herds of llamas and slaves were still understood
to belong to them, and food and drink were placed before them at stated
intervals. Clothes were made for them, and they were carried about in
palanquins as if for daily exercise. The descendants of each at
periodical intervals feasted on the produce of their ancestor&rsquo;s
private estate, and his mummy was set in the centre of the diners and
treated as the principal guest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After Manco Ccapac and his immediate successor,
Sinchi Roca (Wise Chief), Lloque Yupanqui comes third in the series. He
died while his son was still a child. Concerning Mayta Ccapac, who
commenced his reign while yet a minor, but little is known. He was
followed by Ccapac Yupanqui, who defeated the Conti-suyu, who had grown
alarmed at the great power recently attained by Cuzco. The Inca and his
men were attacked whilst about to offer sacrifice. A second attempt to
sack Cuzco and divide its spoil and the women attached to the great
Temple of the Sun likewise ended in the total discomfiture of the
jealous invaders. With Inca Roca, the next Inca, a new dynasty
commences, but it is well-nigh impossible to trace the connection
between it and the preceding one. Of the origin of Inca Roca nothing is
related save that he claimed descent from Manco Ccapac. Roca, instead
of waiting to be attacked in his own dominions, boldly confronted the
Conti-suyu in their own territory, defeated them decisively at
Pumatampu, and compelled them to yield him tribute. His successor,
Yahuarhuaccac, initiated a similar campaign against the Colla-suyu
people, against whom he had the assistance of the conquered Conti-suyu.
But at a feast which he held in Cuzco before setting out he was
attacked by his allies, and fled to the Coricancha, or Golden Temple of
the Sun, for refuge, along with his wives. Resistance was unavailing,
and the Inca and many of his favourites were slaughtered. The allied
tribes which had overrun Central Peru now threatened Cuzco, and had
they advanced with promptitude the Inca dynasty would have been wiped
out and the city reduced to ruins. A strong man was at hand, however,
who was capable of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>dealing with the extremely dangerous
situation which had arisen. This was Viracocha, a chieftain chosen by
the vote of the assembled warriors of Cuzco. By a prudent conciliation
of the Conti-suyu and Colla-suyu he established a confederation which
not only put an end to all threats of invasion, but so menaced the
invaders that they were glad to return to their own territory and place
it in a suitable state of defence.</p>

<p class="par first">With Viracocha the Great, or
&ldquo;Godlike,&rdquo; the period of true Inca ascendancy commences. He
was the real founder of the enlarged Inca dominion. He was elected Inca
on his personal merits, and during a vigorous reign succeeded in making
the influence of Cuzco felt in the contiguous southern regions. In his
old age he retired to his country seats at Yucay and Xaquixahuana, and
left the conduct of the realm to his son and successor, Urco-Inca, a
weak-minded voluptuary, who neglected his royal duties, and was
superseded by his younger brother, Pachacutic, a famous character in
Inca history.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The commencement of Pachacutic&rsquo;s reign
witnessed one of the most sanguinary battles in the history of Peru.
Hastu-huaraca, chief of the Antahuayllas, in the Chanca country,
invaded the Inca territory, and encamped on the hills of Carmenca,
which overlooks Cuzco. Pachacutic held a parley with him, but all to no
purpose, for the powerful invader was determined to humble the Inca
dynasty to the dust. Battle was speedily joined. The first day&rsquo;s
fight was indecisive, but on the succeeding day Pachacutic won a great
victory, the larger part of the invading <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>force being left dead
on the field of battle, and Hastu-huaraca retreating with five hundred
followers only. The battle of Yahuar-pampa (Plain of Blood) was the
turning-point in Peruvian history. The young Inca, formerly known as
Yupanqui, was now called Pachacutic (He who changes the World). The
warriors of the south made full submission to him, and came in crowds
to offer him their services and seek his alliance and friendship, and
he shortly found himself supreme in the territories over which his
predecessors had exercised merely a nominal control.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Hastu-huaraca, who had been commissioned by the
allied tribesmen of Chinchay-suyu to reduce the Incas, now threw in his
lot with them, and together conqueror and conquered proceeded to the
liberation of the district of Chinchay-suyu from the tyranny of the
Huanca alliance. The reduction of the southern portion of that
territory was speedily accomplished. In the valley of Xauxa the
invaders came upon the army of the Huanca, on which they inflicted a
final defeat. The Inca spared and liberated the prisoners of war, who
were numerous. Once more, at Tarma, were the Huanca beaten, after which
all resistance appears to have been overcome. The city-state of Cuzco
was now the dominant power throughout the whole of Central Peru, a
territory 300 miles in length, whilst it exercised a kind of suzerainty
over a district of equal extent toward the south-east, which it shortly
converted into actual dominion.</p>

the more numerous Quichua speedily gained linguistic ascendancy over
their brethren the Aymara. Subsequently to this the peoples of Southern
and Central Peru, led by Inca headmen, swept in a great wave of
migration over Cerro de Pasco, where they met with little or no
resistance, and Pachacutic lived to be lord over a dominion extending
for a thousand miles to the northward, and founder of a great Inca
colony south of the equator almost identical in outline with the
republic of Ecuador.</p>

of which were well-nigh a thousand miles apart. The centre of the
northern district was at Tumipampa, Riopampa, and Quito at different
periods. The political separation of these areas was only a question of
time. Geographical conditions almost totally divided the two portions
of the empire, a sparsely populated stretch of country 400 miles in
extent lying between them (see map, p. 333.)</p>

<h3 class="main">The Laws of Pachacutic</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Pachacutic united to his fame as a warrior the
reputation of a wise and liberal ruler. He built the great Temple of
the Sun at Cuzco, probably on the site of a still older building, and
established in its walls the convent in which five hundred maidens were
set apart for the service of the god. He also, it is said, instituted
the great rite of the Ccapac-cocha, at which maize, cloth, llamas, and
children were sacrificed in honour of the sun-god. He devised a kind of
census, by which governors were compelled periodically to render an
account of the population under their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>rule. This statement
was made by means of <i>quipos</i>. Agriculture was his peculiar care,
and he was stringent in the enforcement of laws regarding the tilling
of the soil, the foundation and upkeep of stores and granaries, and the
regulation of labour in general. As an architect he took upon himself
the task of personally designing the principal buildings of the city of
Cuzco, which were rebuilt under his instructions and in accordance with
models moulded from clay by his own hands. He appears to have had a
passion for order, and to him we may be justified in tracing the
rigorous and almost grandmotherly system under which the Peruvians were
living at the time of the arrival of their Spanish conquerors. To
Pachacutic, too, is assigned the raising of the immense fortress of
Sacsahuaman, already described. He further instituted the order of
knighthood known as Auqui, or &ldquo;Warrior,&rdquo; entrance to which
was granted to suitable applicants at the great feast of Ccapac Raymi,
or Festival of the Sun. He also named the succession of moons, and
erected the pillars on the hill of Carmenca by which the season of
solstice was found. In short, all law and order which had a place in
the Peruvian social economy were attributed to him, and we may
designate him the Alfred of his race.</p>

<p class="par">A spirit of cruelty and excess such as was unknown to
Pachacutic marked the military exploits of Tupac. In the valley of
Huarco, near the Pacific coast, for example, he was repulsed by the
natives, who were well supplied with food and stores of all sorts, and
whose town was well fortified and very strongly situated. Tupac
constructed an immense camp, or rather town, the outlines of which
recalled those of his capital of Cuzco, on a hill opposite the city,
and here he calmly sat down to watch the gradual starvation of the
enemy. This siege continued for three years, until the wretched
defenders, driven to despair through want of food, capitulated, relying
on the assurance of their conqueror that they should become a part of
the Inca nation and that their daughters should become the wives of
Inca youths. The submission of their chiefs having been made, Tupac
ordered a general massacre of the warriors and principal civilians. At
the conquest the Spaniards could still see the immense heaps of bones
which littered the spot where this heartless holocaust took place, and
the name Huarco (The Gibbet) became indissolubly associated with the
district.</p>

savage peoples who surrounded his empire in check. He favoured the
northern colony, and rebuilt Tumipampa, but resided at Quito. Here he
dwelt for some years with a favourite son by a wife of the lower class,
named Tupac-atau-huallpa (The Sun makes Good Fortune). Huaina was the
victim of an epidemic raging in Peru at the time. He was greatly feared
by his subjects, and was the last Inca who held undisputed sway over
the entire dominion. Like Nezahualcoyotl in Mexico, he attempted to set
up the worship of one god in Peru, to the detriment of all other
<i>huacas</i>, or sacred beings.</p>

Huaina had divided his dominion between his two sons, but it was said
that he had wrested Quito from a certain chieftain whose daughter he
had married, and by whom he had Atauhuallpa, who was therefore rightful
heir to that province. The other son, Huascar, or Tupac-cusi-huallpa
(The Sun makes Joy), was born to his principal sister-wife&mdash;for,
according to Inca custom, the monarchs of Peru, like those of certain
Egyptian dynasties, filled with pride of race, and unwilling to mingle
their blood with that of plebeians, took spouses from among their
sisters. This is the story as given by many Spanish chroniclers, but it
has no foundation in fact. Atauhuallpa was in reality the son of a
woman of the people, and Huascar was not the son of Huaina&rsquo;s
sister-wife, but of a wife of less intimate relationship. Therefore
both sons were on an equality as regards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

however, was nearer the throne by virtue of his mother&rsquo;s status,
which was that of a royal princess, whereas the mother of Atauhuallpa
was not officially recognised. Huascar by his excesses and his outrages
on religion and public decency aroused the people to revolt against his
power, and Atauhuallpa, discerning his opportunity in this
<i>&eacute;meute</i>, made a determined attack on the royal forces, and
succeeded in driving them slowly back, until at last Tumipampa was
razed to the ground, and shortly afterwards the important southerly
fortress of Caxamarca fell into the hands of the rebels.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The religion of the ancient Peruvians had
obviously developed in a much shorter time than that of the Mexicans.
The more ancient character inherent in it was displayed in the presence
of deities many of which were little better than mere totems, and
although a definite monotheism or worship of one god appears to have
been reached, it was not by the efforts of the priestly caste that this
was achieved, but rather by the will of the Inca Pachacutic, who seems
to have been a monarch gifted with rare insight and ability&mdash;a man
much after the type of the Mexican Nezahualcoyotl.</p>
<p class="par">In Inca times the religion of the people was solely
directed by the state, and regulated in such a manner that independent
theological thought was permitted no outlet. But it must not be
inferred from this that no change had ever come over the spirit of
Peruvian religion. As a matter of fact sweeping changes had been
effected, but these had been solely the work of the Inca race, the
leaders of which had amalgamated the various faiths of the peoples whom
they had conquered into one official belief.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega, an early Spanish
writer on matters Peruvian, states that tradition ran that in ante-Inca
times every district, family, and village possessed its own god, each
different from the others. These gods were usually such objects as
trees, mountains, flowers, herbs, caves, large stones, pieces of
jasper, and animals. The jaguar, puma, and bear were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>worshipped for their strength and fierceness,
the monkey and fox for their cunning, the condor for its size and
because several tribes believed themselves to be descended from it. The
screech-owl was worshipped for its beauty, and the common owl for its
power of seeing in the dark. Serpents, particularly the larger and more
dangerous varieties, were especially regarded with reverence.</p>
<p class="par">Although Payne classes all these gods together as
totems, it is plain that those of the first class&mdash;the flowers,
herbs, caves, and pieces of jasper&mdash;are merely fetishes. A fetish
is an object in which the savage believes to be resident a spirit
which, by its magic, will assist him in his undertakings. A totem is an
object or an animal, usually the latter, with which the people of a
tribe believe themselves to be connected by ties of blood and from
which they are descended. It later becomes the type or symbol of the
tribe.</p>

Guard me from evil, O Paccarisca!&rdquo; In the holy spot a spirit was
supposed to dwell which served the tribe as a kind of oracle. Naturally
the <i>paccarisca</i> was looked upon with extreme reverence. It
became, indeed, a sort of life-centre for the tribe, from which they
were very unwilling to be separated.</p>

<h3 class="main">Worship of Stones</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The worship of stones appears to have been almost
as universal in ancient Peru as it was in ancient Palestine.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>Man in his primitive state believes stones to be
the framework of the earth, its bony structure. He considers himself to
have emerged from some cave&mdash;in fact, from the entrails of the
earth. Nearly all American creation-myths regard man as thus emanating
from the bowels of the great terrestrial mother. Rocks which were thus
chosen as <i>paccariscas</i> are found, among many other places, at
Callca, in the valley of the Yucay, and at Titicaca there is a great
mass of red sandstone on the top of a high ridge with almost
inaccessible slopes and dark, gloomy recesses where the sun was thought
to have hidden himself at the time of the great deluge which covered
all the earth. The rock of Titicaca was, in fact, the great
<i>paccarisca</i> of the sun itself.</p>
<p class="par">We are thus not surprised to find that many standing
stones were worshipped in Peru in aboriginal times. Thus Arriaga states
that rocks of great size which bore some resemblance to the human
figure were imagined to have been at one time gigantic men or spirits
who, because they disobeyed the creative power, were turned into stone.
According to another account they were said to have suffered this
punishment for refusing to listen to the words of Thonapa, the son of
the creator, who, like Quetzalcoatl or Manco Ccapac, had taken upon
himself the guise of a wandering Indian, so that he might have an
opportunity of bringing the arts of civilisation to the aborigines. At
Tiahuanaco a certain group of stones was said to represent all that
remained of the villagers of that place, who, instead of paying fitting
attention to the wise counsel which Thonapa the Civiliser bestowed upon
them, continued to dance and drink in scorn of the teachings he had
brought to them.</p>
<p class="par">Again, some stones were said to have become men,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>as in the old Greek creation-legend of Deucalion
and Pyrrha. In the legend of Ccapac Inca Pachacutic, when Cuzco was
attacked in force by the Chancas an Indian erected stones to which he
attached shields and weapons so that they should appear to represent so
many warriors in hiding. Pachacutic, in great need of assistance, cried
to them with such vehemence to come to his help that they became men,
and rendered him splendid service.</p>

<h3 class="main">Huacas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Whatever was sacred, of sacred origin, or of the
nature of a relic the Peruvians designated a <i>huaca</i>, from the
root <i>huacan</i>, to howl, native worship invariably taking the form
of a kind of howl, or weird, dirge-like wailing. All objects of
reverence were known as <i>huacas</i>, although those of a higher class
were also alluded to as <i>viracochas</i>. The Peruvians had,
naturally, many forms of <i>huaca</i>, the most popular of which were
those of the fetish class which could be carried about by the
individual. These were usually stones or pebbles, many of which were
carved and painted, and some made to represent human beings. The llama
and the ear of maize were perhaps the most usual forms of these sacred
objects. Some of them had an agricultural significance. In order that
irrigation might proceed favourably a <i>huaca</i> was placed at
intervals in proximity to the <i>acequias</i>, or irrigation canals,
which was supposed to prevent them leaking or otherwise failing to
supply a sufficiency of moisture to the parched maize-fields.
<i>Huacas</i> of this sort were known as <i>ccompas</i>, and were
regarded as deities of great importance, as the food-supply of the
community was thought to be wholly dependent upon their assistance.
Other <i>huacas</i> of a similar kind were called <i>chichics</i> and
<i>huancas</i>, and these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>presided over the fortunes of the
maize, and ensured that a sufficient supply of rain should be
forthcoming. Great numbers of these agricultural fetishes were
destroyed by the zealous commissary Hernandez de Avenda&ntilde;o.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Mamas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Spirits which were supposed to be instrumental in
forcing the growth of the maize or other plants were the <i>mamas</i>.
We find a similar conception among many Brazilian tribes to-day, so
that the idea appears to have been a widely accepted one in South
American countries. The Peruvians called such agencies
&ldquo;mothers,&rdquo; adding to the generic name that of the plant or
herb with which they were specially associated. Thus <i>acsumama</i>
was the potato-mother, <i>quinuamama</i> the quinua-mother,
<i>saramama</i> the maize-mother, and <i>cocamama</i> the mother of the
coca-shrub. Of these the <i>saramama</i> was naturally the most
important, governing as it did the principal source of the food-supply
of the community. Sometimes an image of the <i>saramama</i> was carved
in stone, in the shape of an ear of maize. The <i>saramama</i> was also
worshipped in the form of a doll, or <i>huantaysara</i>, made out of
stalks of maize, renewed at each harvest, much as the idols of the
great corn-mother of Mexico were manufactured at each harvest-season.
After having been made, the image was watched over for three nights,
and then sacrifice was done to it. The priest or medicine-man of the
tribe would then inquire of it whether or not it was capable of
existing until that time in the next year. If its spirit replied in the
affirmative it was permitted to remain where it was until the following
harvest. If not it was removed, burnt, and another figure took its
place, to which similar questions were put. <span class=

suitable food and drink offerings. As the number of ancestors increased
more and more land was brought into cultivation, and the hapless people

<p class="par first">The Peruvian Indians of the Andes range within
recent generations continued to adhere to the superstitions they had
inherited from their fathers. A rare and interesting account of these
says that they &ldquo;admit an evil being, the inhabitant of the centre
of the earth, whom they consider as the author of their misfortunes,
and at the mention of whose name they tremble. The most shrewd among
them take advantage of this belief to obtain respect, and represent
themselves as his delegates. Under the denomination of <i>mohanes</i>,
or <i>agoreros</i>, they are consulted even on the most trivial
occasions. They preside over the intrigues of love, the health of the
community, and the taking of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to
defeat their prognostics, falls on themselves; and they are wont to pay
for their deceptions very dearly. They chew a species of vegetable
called <i>piripiri</i>, and throw it into the air, accompanying this
act by certain recitals and incantations, to injure some, to benefit
others, to procure rain and the inundation of the rivers, or, on the
other hand, to occasion settled weather, and a plentiful store of
agricultural productions. Any such result, having been casually
verified on a single occasion, suffices to confirm the Indians in their
faith, although they may have been cheated a thousand times. Fully
persuaded that they cannot resist the influence of the <i>piripiri</i>,
as soon as they know that they have been solicited in love by its
means, they fix their eyes on the impassioned object, and discover a
thousand amiable traits, either real or fanciful, which indifference
had before concealed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298"
name="pb298">298</a>]</span>from their view. But the principal power,
efficacy, and it may be said misfortune of the <i>mohanes</i> consist
in the cure of the sick. Every malady is ascribed to their
enchantments, and means are instantly taken to ascertain by whom the
mischief may have been wrought. For this purpose, the nearest relative
takes a quantity of the juice of <i>floripondium</i>, and suddenly
falls intoxicated by the violence of the plant. He is placed in a fit
posture to prevent suffocation, and on his coming to himself, at the
end of three days, the <i>mohane</i> who has the greatest resemblance
to the sorcerer he saw in his visions is to undertake the cure, or if,
in the interim, the sick man has perished, it is customary to subject
him to the same fate. When not any sorcerer occurs in the visions, the
first <i>mohane</i> they encounter has the misfortune to represent his
image.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd22e5138src" href="#xd22e5138"

inhabitants of the earth, animals as well as men, to have been
fashioned by the creator, and the district was thus sacrosanct in their
eyes. The people of the Collao called it Mamacota (Mother-water),
because it furnished them with supplies of food. Two great idols were
connected with this worship. One called Copacahuana was made of a
bluish-green stone shaped like a fish with a human head, and was placed
in a commanding position on the shores of the lake. On the arrival of
the Spaniards so deeply rooted was the worship of this goddess that
they could only suppress it by raising an image of the Virgin in place
of the idol. The Christian emblem remains to this day. Mamacota was
venerated as the giver of fish, with which the lake abounded. The other
image, Copacati <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299"
name="pb299">299</a>]</span>(Serpent-stone), represented the element of
water as embodied in the lake itself in the form of an image wreathed

Huaina Ccapac, who had modern ideas and journeyed through the country
casting down <i>huacas</i>, had determined to raise on an island of
Lake Titicaca a temple to Yatiri (The Ruler), the Aymara name of the
god Pachacamac in his form of Pachayachachic. He commenced by raising
the new shrine on the island of Titicaca itself. But the deity when
called upon refused to vouchsafe any reply to his worshippers or
priests. Huaina then commanded that the shrine should be transferred to
the island of Apinguela. But the same thing happened there. He then
inaugurated a temple on the island of Paapiti, and lavished upon it
many sacrifices of llamas, children, and precious metals. But the
offended tutelary goddess of the lake, irritated beyond endurance by
this invasion of her ancient domain, lashed the watery waste into such
a frenzy of storm that the island and the shrine which covered it
disappeared beneath the waves and were never thereafter beheld by
mortal eye.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Thunder-God of Peru</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The rain-and-thunder god of Peru was worshipped in
various parts of the country under various names. Among the Collao he
was known as Con, and in that part of the Inca dominions now known as
Bolivia he was called Churoquella. Near the cordilleras of the coast he
was probably known as Pariacaca, who expelled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>the
<i>huaca</i> of the district by dreadful tempests, hurling rain and
hail at him for three days and nights in such quantities as to form the
great lake of Pariacaca. Burnt llamas were offered to him. But the
Incas, discontented with this local worship, which by no means suited
their system of central government, determined to create one
thunder-deity to whom all the tribes in the empire must bow as the only
god of his class. We are not aware what his name was, but we know from
mythological evidence that he was a mixture of all the other gods of
thunder in the Peruvian Empire, first because he invariably occupied
the third place in the triad of greater deities, the creator, sun, and
thunder, all of whom were more or less amalgamations of provincial and
metropolitan gods, and secondly because a great image of him was
erected in the Coricancha at Cuzco, in which he was represented in
human form, wearing a headdress which concealed his face, symbolic of
the clouds, which ever veil the thunder-god&rsquo;s head. He had a
special temple of his own, moreover, and was assigned a share in the
sacred lands by the Inca Pachacutic. He was accompanied by a figure of
his sister, who carried jars of water. An unknown Quichuan poet
composed on the myth the following graceful little poem, which was
translated by the late Daniel Garrison Brinton, an enthusiastic
Americanist and professor of American arch&aelig;ology in the
University of Pennsylvania:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Bounteous Princess,</p>
<p class="line">Lo, thy brother</p>
<p class="line">Breaks thy vessel</p>
<p class="line">Now in fragments.</p>

<p class="line">Strokes of lightning; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="line">With it rainest,</p>
<p class="line">And the hail or</p>
<p class="line">Snow dispensest,</p>
<p class="line">Viracocha,</p>
<p class="line">World-constructor.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It will be observed that the translator here
employs the name Viracocha as if it were that of the deity. But it was
merely a general expression in use for a more than usually sacred
being. Brinton, commenting upon the legend, says: &ldquo;In this pretty
waif that has floated down to us from the wreck of a literature now for
ever lost there is more than one point to attract the notice of the
antiquary. He may find in it a hint to decipher those names of
divinities so common in Peruvian legends, Contici and Illatici. Both
mean &lsquo;the Thunder Vase,&rsquo; and both doubtless refer to the
conception here displayed of the phenomena of the thunderstorm.&rdquo;
Alluding to Peruvian thunder-myth elsewhere, he says in an illuminating
passage: &ldquo;Throughout the realms of the Incas the Peruvians
venerated as maker of all things and ruler of the firmament the god
Ataguju. The legend was that from him proceeded the first of mortals,
the man Guamansuri, who descended to the earth and there wedded the
sister of certain Guachimines, rayless ones or Darklings, who then
possessed it. They destroyed him, but their sister gave birth to twin
sons, Apocatequil and Piguerao. The former was the more powerful. By
touching the corpse of his mother he brought her to life, he drove off
and slew the Guachimines, and, directed by Ataguju, released the race
of Indians from the soil by turning it up with a spade of gold. For
this reason they adored him as their maker. He it was, they thought,
who produced the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span>thunder and the lightning by hurling stones
with his sling. And the thunderbolts that fall, said they, are his
children. Few villages were willing to be without one or more of these.
They were in appearance small, round stones, but had the admirable
properties of securing fertility to the fields, protecting from
lightning, and, by a transition easy to understand, were also adored as
gods of fire as well material as of the passions, and were capable of
kindling the dangerous flames of desire in the most frigid bosoms.
Therefore they were in great esteem as love-charms. Apocatequil&rsquo;s
statue was erected on the mountains, with that of his mother on one
hand and his brother on the other. &lsquo;He was Prince of Evil, and
the most respected god of the Peruvians. From Quito to Cuzco not an
Indian but would give all he possessed to conciliate him. Five priests,
two stewards, and a crowd of slaves served his image. And his chief
temple was surrounded by a very considerable village, whose inhabitants
had no other occupation but to wait on him.&rsquo;&rdquo; In memory of
these brothers twins in Peru were always deemed sacred to the
lightning.</p>
<p class="par">There is an instance on record of how the <i>huillca</i>
could refuse on occasion to recognise even royalty itself. Manco, the
Inca who had been given the kingly power by Pizarro, offered a
sacrifice to one of these oracular shrines. The oracle refused to
recognise him, through the medium of its guardian priest, stating that
Manco was not the rightful Inca. Manco therefore caused the oracle,
which was in the shape of a rock, to be thrown down, whereupon its
guardian spirit emerged in the form of a parrot and flew away. It is
probable that the bird thus liberated had been taught by the priests to
answer to the questions of those who came to consult the shrine. But we
learn that on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Later Peruvian mythology recognised only three
gods of the first rank, the earth, the thunder, and the creative
agency. Pachacamac, the great spirit of earth, derived his name from a
word <i>pacha</i>, which may be best translated as
&ldquo;things.&rdquo; In its sense of visible things it is equivalent
to &ldquo;world,&rdquo; applied to things which happen in succession it
denotes &ldquo;time,&rdquo; and to things connected with persons
&ldquo;property,&rdquo; especially clothes. The world of visible things
is thus Mamapacha (Earth-Mother), under which name the ancient
Peruvians worshipped the earth. Pachacamac, on the other hand, is not
the earth itself, the soil, but the spirit which animates all things
that emerge therefrom. From him proceed the spirits of the plants and
animals which come from the earth. Pachamama is the mother-spirit of
the mountains, rocks, and plains, Pachacamac the father-spirit of the
grain-bearing plants, animals, birds, and man. In some localities
Pachacamac and Pachamama were worshipped as divine mates. Possibly this
practice was universal in early times, gradually lapsing into desuetude
in later days. Pachamama was in another phase intended to denote the
land immediately contiguous to a settlement, on which the inhabitants
depended for their food-supply.</p>

<p class="par first">It is easy to see how such a conception as

there was a pre-existing conception of a creative agency can be proved
from the existence of the Peruvian name Conticsi-viracocha (He who
gives Origin, or Beginning). This conception and that of Pachacamac
must at some comparatively early period have clashed, and been
amalgamated probably with ease when it was seen how nearly akin were
the two ideas. Indeed, Pachacamac was alternatively known as
Pacharurac, the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; of all things&mdash;sure proof of
his amalgamation with the conception of the creative agency. As such he
had his symbol in the great Coricancha at Cuzco, an oval plate of gold,
suspended between those of the sun and the moon, and placed vertically,
it may be hazarded with some probability, to represent in symbol that
universal matrix from which emanated all things. Elsewhere in Cuzco the
creator was represented by a stone statue in human form.</p>

theology. He commanded a great new temple to the creator-god to be
built at the north angle of the city of Cuzco, in which he placed a
statue of pure gold, of the size of a boy of ten years of age. The
small size was to facilitate its removal, as Peruvian worship was
nearly always carried out in the open air. In form it represented a man
with his right arm elevated, the hand partially closed and the
forefinger and thumb raised, as if in the act of uttering the creative
word. To this god large possessions and revenues were assigned, for

But his youngest brother succeeded in enticing him into a cave, which

cast him, changing him into a stone in his descent. On beholding the
fate of his brethren the third member of the quartette fled. It is
obvious that we have here a legend concocted by the later Inca

the power, temporal and spiritual, in the hands of the reputed

<h3 class="main">Worship of the Sea</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The ancient Peruvians worshipped the sea as well
as the earth, the folk inland regarding it as a menacing deity, whilst
the people of the coast reverenced it as a god of benevolence, calling
it Mama-cocha, or Mother-sea, as it yielded them subsistence in the
form of fish, on which they chiefly lived. They worshipped the whale,
fairly common on that coast, because of its enormous size, and various
districts regarded with adoration the species of fish most abundant
there. This worship can have partaken in no sense of the nature of
totemism, as the system forbade that the totem animal should be eaten.
It was imagined that the prototype of each variety of fish dwelt in the
upper world, just as many tribes of North American Indians believe that
the eponymous ancestors of certain animals dwell at the four points of
the compass or in the sky above them. This great fish-god engendered
the others of his species, and sent them into the waters of the deep
that they might exist there until taken for the use of man. Birds, too,
had their eponymous counterparts among the stars, as had animals.
Indeed, among many of the South American races, ancient and modern, the
constellations were called after certain beasts and birds. <span class=

<p class="par first">The Aymara-Quichua race worshipped Viracocha as a
great culture hero. They did not offer him sacrifices or tribute, as
they thought that he, being creator and possessor of all things, needed
nothing from men, so they only gave him worship. After him they
idolised the sun. They believed, indeed, that Viracocha had made both
sun and moon, after emerging from Lake Titicaca, and that then he made
the earth and peopled it. On his travels westward from the lake he was
sometimes assailed by men, but he revenged himself by sending terrible
storms upon them and destroying their property, so they humbled
themselves and acknowledged him as their lord. He forgave them and
taught them everything, obtaining from them the name of Pachayachachic.
In the end he disappeared in the western ocean. He either created or
there were born with him four beings who, according to mythical
beliefs, civilised Peru. To them he assigned the four quarters of the
earth, and they are thus known as the four winds, north, south, east,
and west. One legend avers they came from the cave Pacari, the Lodging
of the Dawn.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sun-Worship in Peru</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The name &ldquo;Inca&rdquo; means &ldquo;People of
the Sun,&rdquo; which luminary the Incas regarded as their creator. But
they did not worship him totemically&mdash;that is, they did not claim
him as a progenitor, although they regarded him as possessing the
attributes of a man. And here we may observe a difference between
Mexican and Peruvian sun-worship. For whereas the Nahua primarily
regarded the orb as the abode of the Man of the Sun, who came to earth
in the shape of Quetzalcoatl, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308"
href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>the Peruvians looked upon the
sun itself as the deity. The Inca race did not identify their ancestors
as children of the sun until a comparatively late date. Sun-worship was
introduced by the Inca Pachacutic, who averred that the sun appeared to
him in a dream and addressed him as his child. Until that time the
worship of the sun had always been strictly subordinated to that of the
creator, and the deity appeared only as second in the trinity of
creator, sun, and thunder. But permanent provision was made for
sacrifices to the sun before the other deities were so recognised, and
as the conquests of the Incas grew wider and that provision extended to
the new territories they came to be known as &ldquo;the Lands of the
Sun,&rdquo; the natives observing the dedication of a part of the
country to the luminary, and concluding therefrom that it applied to
the whole. The material reality of the sun would enormously assist his
cult among a people who were too barbarous to appreciate an unseen god,
and this colonial conception reacting upon the mother-land would
undoubtedly inspire the military class with a resolve to strengthen a
worship so popular in the conquered provinces, and of which they were
in great measure the protagonists and missionaries.</p>

<p class="par first">In every Peruvian village the sun had considerable
possessions. His estates resembled those of a territorial chieftain,
and consisted of a dwelling-house, a <i>chacra</i>, or portion of land,
flocks of llamas and pacos, and a number of women dedicated to his
service. The cultivation of the soil within the solar enclosure
devolved upon the inhabitants of the neighbouring village, the produce
of their toil being stored in the <i>inti-huasi</i>, or sun&rsquo;s
house. The Women of the Sun <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>prepared the daily food and drink
of the luminary, which consisted of maize and <i>chicha</i>. They also
spun wool and wove it into fine stuff, which was burned in order that
it might ascend to the celestial regions, where the deity could make
use of it. Each village reserved a portion of its solar produce for the
great festival at Cuzco, and it was carried thither on the backs of
llamas which were destined for sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class="main">Inca Occupation of Titicaca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rock of Titicaca, the renowned place of the
sun&rsquo;s origin, naturally became an important centre of his
worship. The date at which the worship of the sun originated at this
famous rock is extremely remote, but we may safely assume that it was
long before the conquest of the Collao by the Apu-Ccapac-Inca
Pachacutic, and that reverence for the luminary as a war-god by the
Colla chiefs was noticed by Tupac, who in suppressing the revolt
concluded that the local observance at the rock had some relationship
to the disturbance. It is, however, certain that Tupac proceeded after
the reconquest to establish at this natural centre of sun-worship solar
rites on a new basis, with the evident intention of securing on behalf
of the Incas of Cuzco such exclusive benefit as might accrue from the
complete possession of the sun&rsquo;s <i>paccarisca</i>. According to
a native account, a venerable <i>colla</i> (or hermit), consecrated to
the service of the sun, had proceeded on foot from Titicaca to Cuzco
for the purpose of commending this ancient seat of sun-worship to the
notice of Tupac. The consequence was that Apu-Ccapac-Inca, after
visiting the island and inquiring into the ancient local customs,
re-established them in a more regular form. His accounts can hardly be
accepted in face of the facts which have been gathered. Rather did it
naturally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>follow that Titicaca became subservient to Tupac
after the revolt of the Collao had been quelled. Henceforth the worship
of the sun at the place of his origin was entrusted to Incas resident
in the place, and was celebrated with Inca rites. The island was
converted into a solar estate and the aboriginal inhabitants removed.
The land was cultivated and the slopes of the hills levelled, maize was
sown and the soil consecrated, the grain being regarded as the gift of
the sun. This work produced considerable change in the island. Where
once was waste and idleness there was now fertility and industry. The
harvests were skilfully apportioned, so much being reserved for
sacrificial purposes, the remainder being sent to Cuzco, partly to be
sown in the <i>chacras</i>, or estates of the sun, throughout Peru,
partly to be preserved in the granary of the Inca and the <i>huacas</i>
as a symbol that there would be abundant crops in the future and that
the grain already stored would be preserved. A building of the Women of
the Sun was erected about a mile from the rock, so that the produce
might be available for sacrifices. For their maintenance, tribute of
potatoes, ocas, and quinua was levied upon the inhabitants of the
villages on the shores of the lake, and of maize upon the people of the
neighbouring valleys.</p>

<h3 class="main">Pilgrimages to Titicaca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Titicaca at the time of the conquest was probably
more frequented than Pachacamac itself. These two places were held to
be the cardinal shrines of the two great <i>huacas</i>, the creator and
the sun respectively. A special reason for pilgrimage to Titicaca was
to sacrifice to the sun, as the source of physical energy and the giver
of long life; and he was especially worshipped by the aged, who
believed he had preserved their lives, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>Then followed the
migration of pilgrims to Titicaca, for whose shelter houses were built
at Capacahuana, and large stores of maize were provided for their use.
The ceremonial connected with the sacred rites of the rock was
rigorously observed. The pilgrim ere embarking on the raft which
conveyed him to the island must first confess his sins to a
<i>huillac</i> (a speaker to an object of worship); then further
confessions were required at each of the three sculptured doors which
had successively to be passed before reaching the sacred rock. The
first door (Puma-puncu) was surmounted by the figure of a puma; the
others (Quenti-puncu and Pillco-puncu) were ornamented with feathers of
the different species of birds commonly sacrificed to the sun. Having
passed the last portal, the traveller beheld at a distance of two
hundred paces the sacred rock itself, the summit glittering with
gold-leaf. He was permitted to proceed no further, for only the
officials were allowed entry into it. The pilgrim on departing received
a few grains of the sacred maize grown on the island. These he kept
with care and placed with his own store, believing they would preserve
his stock, The confidence the Indian placed in the virtue of the
Titicaca maize may be judged from the prevalent belief that the
possessor of a single grain would not suffer from starvation during the
whole of his life.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sacrifices to the New Sun</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Intip-Raymi, or Great Festival of the Sun, was
celebrated by the Incas at Cuzco at the winter solstice. In connection
with it the Tarpuntaita-cuma, or sacrificing Incas, were charged with a
remarkable duty, the worshippers journeying eastward to meet one of
these functionaries on his way. On the principal hill-tops between
Cuzco and Huillcanuta, on the road to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>rock of Titicaca,
burnt offerings of llamas, coca, and maize were made at the feast to
greet the arrival of the young sun from his ancient birthplace. Molina
has enumerated more than twenty of these places of sacrifice. The
striking picture of the celebration of the solar sacrifice on these
bleak mountains in the depth of the Peruvian winter has, it seems, no
parallel in the religious rites of the ancient Americans. Quitting
their thatched houses at early dawn, the worshippers left the valley
below, carrying the sacrificial knife and brazier, and conducting the
white llama, heavily laden with fuel, maize, and coca leaves, wrapped
in fine cloth, to the spot where the sacrifice was to be made. When
sunrise appeared the pile was lighted. The victim was slain and thrown
upon it. The scene then presented a striking contrast to the bleak
surrounding wilderness. As the flames grew in strength and the smoke
rose higher and thicker the clear atmosphere was gradually illuminated
from the east. When the sun advanced above the horizon the sacrifice
was at its height. But for the crackling of the flames and the murmur
of a babbling stream on its way down the hill to join the river below,
the silence had hitherto been unbroken. As the sun rose the Incas
marched slowly round the burning mass, plucking the wool from the
scorched carcase, and chanting monotonously: &ldquo;O Creator, Sun and
Thunder, be for ever young! Multiply the people; let them ever be in
peace!&rdquo;</p>

which no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=

Inca, accompanied by the people <i>en masse</i>, proceeded to the great
square of Cuzco to hail the rising sun, which they awaited in silence.
On its appearance they greeted it with a joyous tumult, and, joining in
procession, marched to the Golden Temple of the Sun, where llamas were
sacrificed, and a new fire was kindled by means of an arched mirror,
followed by sacrificial offerings of grain, flowers, animals, and
aromatic gums. This festival may be taken as typical of all the
seasonal celebrations. The Inca calendar was purely agricultural in its
basis, and marked in its great festivals the renewal or abandonment of
the labours of the field. Its astronomical observations were not more
advanced than those of the calendars of many American races otherwise

was certainly not nearly so prevalent in Peru, but that it was regular
and by no means rare is well authenticated. Female victims to the sun
were taken from the great class of Acllacuna (Selected Ones), a general
tribute of female children regularly levied throughout the Inca Empire.
Beautiful girls were taken from their parents at the age of eight by
the Inca officials, and were handed over to certain female trainers
called <i>mamacuna</i> (mothers). These matrons systematically trained
their <i lang="fr">prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> in housewifery and

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A quaint account of the methods of the
medicine-men of the Indians of the Peruvian Andes probably illustrates
the manner in which the superstitions of a barbarian people evolve into
a more stately ritual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It cannot be denied,&rdquo; it states,
&ldquo;that the <i>mohanes</i> [priests] have, by practice and
tradition, acquired a knowledge of many plants and poisons, with which
they effect surprising cures on the one hand, and do much mischief on
the other, but the mania of ascribing the whole to a preternatural
virtue occasions them to blend with their practice a thousand charms
and superstitions. The most customary method of cure is to place two
hammocks close to each other, either in the dwelling, or in the open
air: in one of them the patient lies extended, and in the other the
<i>mohane</i>, or <i>agorero</i>. The latter, in contact with the sick
man, begins by rocking himself, and then proceeds, by a strain in
falsetto, to call on the birds, quadrupeds, and fishes to give health
to the patient. From time to time he rises on his seat, and makes a
thousand extravagant gestures over the sick man, to whom he applies his
powders and herbs, or sucks the wounded or diseased parts. If the
malady augments, the <i>agorero</i>, having been joined by many of the
people, chants a short hymn, addressed to the soul of the patient, with
this burden: &lsquo;Thou must not go, thou must not go.&rsquo; In
repeating this he is joined by the people, until at length a terrible
clamour is raised, and augmented in proportion as the sick man becomes
still fainter and fainter, to the end that it may reach his ears. When
all the charms are unavailing, and death approaches, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>the
<i>mohane</i> leaps from his hammock, and betakes himself to flight,
amid the multitude of sticks, stones, and clods of earth which are
showered on him. Successively all those who belong to the nation
assemble, and, dividing themselves into bands, each of them (if he who
is in his last agonies is a warrior) approaches him, saying:
&lsquo;Whither goest thou? Why dost thou leave us? With whom shall we
proceed to the <i>aucas</i> [the enemies]?&rsquo; They then relate to
him the heroical deeds he has performed, the number of those he has
slain, and the pleasures he leaves behind him. This is practised in
different tones: while some raise the voice, it is lowered by others;
and the poor sick man is obliged to support these importunities without
a murmur, until the first symptoms of approaching dissolution manifest
themselves. Then it is that he is surrounded by a multitude of females,
some of whom forcibly close the mouth and eyes, others envelop him in
the hammock, oppressing him with the whole of their weight, and causing
him to expire before his time, and others, lastly, run to extinguish
the candle, and dissipate the smoke, that the soul, not being able to
perceive the hole through which it may escape, may remain entangled in
the structure of the roof. That this may be speedily effected, and to
prevent its return to the interior of the dwelling, they surround the
entrances with filth, by the stench of which it may be expelled.</p>

immediate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=

women collected for the occasion. As long as this dismal howl subsists,
the latter are subjected to a constant fatigue, raising the palm of the
hand to wipe away the tears, and lowering it to dry it on the ground.
The result of this alternate action is, that a circle of earth, which
gives them a most hideous appearance, is collected about the eyelids
and brows, and they do not wash themselves until the mourning is over.
These first clamours conclude by several good pots of <i>masato</i>, to
assuage the thirst of sorrow, and the company next proceed to make a
great clatter among the utensils of the deceased: some break the
kettles, and others the earthen pots, while others, again, burn the
apparel, to the end that his memory may be the sooner forgotten. If the
defunct has been a <i>cacique</i>, or powerful warrior, his exequies
are performed after the manner of the Romans: they last for many days,
all the people weeping in concert for a considerable space of time, at
daybreak, at noon, in the evening, and at midnight. When the appointed
hour arrives, the mournful music begins in front of the house of the
wife and relatives, the heroical deeds of the deceased being chanted to
the sound of instruments. All the inhabitants of the vicinity unite in
chorus from within their houses, some chirping like birds, others
howling like tigers, and the greater part of them chattering like
monkeys, or croaking like frogs. They constantly leave off by having
recourse to the <i>masato</i>, and by the destruction of whatever the
deceased may have left behind him, the burning of his dwelling being
that which concludes the ceremonies. Among some of the Indians, the
nearest relatives cut off their hair as a token of their grief,

fountain called Susur-pugaio. There he saw a piece of crystal fall into
the fountain, and in this crystal he saw the figure of an Indian, with
three bright rays as of the sun coming from the back of his head. He
wore a <i>hautu</i>, or royal fringe, across the forehead like the
Inca. Serpents wound round his arms and over his shoulders. He had
ear-pieces in his ears like the Incas, and was also dressed like them.
There was the head of a lion between his legs, and another lion was
about his shoulders. Inca Yupanqui took fright at this strange figure,
and was running away when a voice called to him by name telling him not
to be afraid, because it was his father, the sun, whom he beheld, and
that he would conquer many nations, but he must remember his father in
his sacrifices and raise revenues for him, and pay him great reverence.
Then the figure vanished, but the crystal remained, and the Inca
afterwards saw all he wished in it. When he became king he had a statue
of the sun made, resembling the figure as closely as possible, and
ordered all the tribes he had conquered to build splendid temples and

they went home to find food already prepared for them and <i>chicha</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>to drink. This continued for ten days. Then the
elder brother decided to hide himself and discover who brought the
food. Very soon two birds, one Aqua, the other Torito (otherwise
<i>quacamayo</i> birds), appeared dressed as Canaris, and wearing their
hair fastened in the same way. The larger bird removed the
<i>llicella</i>, or mantle the Indians wear, and the man saw that they
had beautiful faces and discovered that the bird-like beings were in
reality women. When he came out the bird-women were very angry and flew
away. When the younger brother came home and found no food he was
annoyed, and determined to hide until the bird-women returned. After
ten days the <i>quacamayos</i> appeared again on their old mission, and
while they were busy the watcher contrived to close the door, and so
prevented the younger bird from escaping. She lived with the brothers
for a long time, and became the mother of six sons and daughters, from
whom all the Canaris proceed. Hence the tribe look upon the
<i>quacamayo</i> birds with reverence, and use their feathers at their
festivals.</p>

<h3 class="main">Thonapa</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Some myths tell of a divine personage called
Thonapa, who appears to have been a hero-god or civilising agent like
Quetzalcoatl. He seems to have devoted his life to preaching to the
people in the various villages, beginning in the provinces of
Colla-suya. When he came to Yamquisupa he was treated so badly that he
would not remain there. He slept in the open air, clad only in a long
shirt and a mantle, and carried a book. He cursed the village. It was
soon immersed in water, and is now a lake. There was an idol in the
form of a woman to which the people offered sacrifice at the top of a
high hill, Cachapucara. This idol Thonapa <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>detested, so he burnt
it, and also destroyed the hill. On another occasion Thonapa cursed a
large assembly of people who were holding a great banquet to celebrate
a wedding, because they refused to listen to his preaching. They were
all changed into stones, which are visible to this day. Wandering
through Peru, Thonapa came to the mountain of Caravaya, and after
raising a very large cross he put it on his shoulders and took it to
the hill Carapucu, where he preached so fervently that he shed tears. A
chief&rsquo;s daughter got some of the water on her head, and the
Indians, imagining that he was washing his head (a ritual offence),
took him prisoner near the Lake of Carapucu. Very early the next
morning a beautiful youth appeared to Thonapa, and told him not to
fear, for he was sent from the divine guardian who watched over him. He
released Thonapa, who escaped, though he was well guarded. He went down
into the lake, his mantle keeping him above the water as a boat would
have done. After Thonapa had escaped from the barbarians he remained on
the rock of Titicaca, afterwards going to the town of Tiya-manacu,
where again he cursed the people and turned them into stones. They were
too bent upon amusement to listen to his preaching. He then followed
the river Chacamarca till it reached the sea, and, like Quetzalcoatl,
disappeared. This is good evidence that he was a solar deity, or
&ldquo;man of the sun,&rdquo; who, his civilising labours completed,
betook himself to the house of his father.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When Manco Ccapac Inca was born a staff which had
been given to his father turned into gold. He had seven brothers and
sisters, and at his father&rsquo;s death he assembled all his people in
order to see how much he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>could venture in making fresh
conquests. He and his brothers supplied themselves with rich clothing,
new arms, and the golden staff called <i>tapac-yauri</i> (royal
sceptre). He had also two cups of gold from which Thonapa had drunk,
called <i>tapacusi</i>. They proceeded to the highest point in the
country, a mountain where the sun rose, and Manco Ccapac saw several
rainbows<span class="corr" id="xd22e5502" title="Source: .">,</span>
which he interpreted as a sign of good fortune<span class="corr" id=
"xd22e5505" title="Source: ,">.</span> Delighted with the favouring
symbols, he sang the song of <i>Chamayhuarisca</i> (The Song of Joy).
Manco Ccapac wondered why a brother who had accompanied him did not
return, and sent one of his sisters in search of him, but she also did
not come back, so he went himself, and found both nearly dead beside a
<i>huaca</i>. They said they could not move, as the <i>huaca</i>, a
stone, retarded them. In a great rage Manco struck this stone with his
<i>tapac-yauri</i>. It spoke, and said that had it not been for his
wonderful golden staff he would have had no power over it. It added
that his brother and sister had sinned, and therefore must remain with
it (the <i>huaca</i>) in the lower regions, but that Manco was to be
&ldquo;greatly honoured.&rdquo; The sad fate of his brother and sister
troubled Manco exceedingly, but on going back to the place where he
first saw the rainbows he got comfort from them and strength to bear
his grief.</p>

<h3 class="main">Coniraya Viracocha</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Coniraya Viracocha was a tricky nature spirit who
declared he was the creator, but who frequently appeared attired as a
poor ragged Indian. He was an adept at deceiving people. A beautiful
woman, Cavillaca, who was greatly admired, was one day weaving a mantle
at the foot of a <i>lucma</i> tree. Coniraya, changing himself into a
beautiful bird, climbed the tree, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322"
href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>took some of his generative
seed, made it into a ripe <i>lucma</i>, and dropped it near the
beautiful virgin, who saw and ate the fruit. Some time afterwards a son
was born to Cavillaca. When the child was older she wished that the
<i>huacas</i> and gods should meet and declare who was the father of
the boy. All dressed as finely as possible, hoping to be chosen as her
husband. Coniraya was there, dressed like a beggar, and Cavillaca never
even looked at him. The maiden addressed the assembly, but as no one
immediately answered her speech she let the child go, saying he would
be sure to crawl to his father. The infant went straight up to
Coniraya, sitting in his rags, and laughed up to him. Cavillaca,
extremely angry at the idea of being associated with such a poor, dirty
creature, fled to the sea-shore. Coniraya then put on magnificent
attire and followed her to show her how handsome he was, but still
thinking of him in his ragged condition she would not look back. She
went into the sea at Pachacamac and was changed into a rock. Coniraya,
still following her, met a condor, and asked if it had seen a woman. On
the condor replying that it had seen her quite near, Coniraya blessed
it, and said whoever killed it would be killed himself. He then met a
fox, who said he would never meet Cavillaca, so Coniraya told him he
would always retain his disagreeable odour, and on account of it he
would never be able to go abroad except at night, and that he would be
hated by every one. Next came a lion, who told Coniraya he was very
near Cavillaca, so the lover said he should have the power of punishing
wrongdoers, and that whoever killed him would wear the skin without
cutting off the head, and by preserving the teeth and eyes would make
him appear still alive; his skin would be worn at festivals, and thus
he would be honoured after death. Then another fox who gave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>bad news was cursed, and a falcon who said
Cavillaca was near was told he would be highly esteemed, and that
whoever killed him would also wear his skin at festivals. The parrots,
giving bad news, were to cry so loud that they would be heard far away,
and their cries would betray them to enemies. Thus Coniraya blessed the
animals which gave him news he liked, and cursed those which gave the
opposite. When at last he came to the sea he found Cavillaca and the
child turned into stone, and there he encountered two beautiful young
daughters of Pachacamac, who guarded a great serpent. He made love to
the elder sister, but the younger one flew away in the form of a wild
pigeon. At that time there were no fishes in the sea, but a certain
goddess had reared a few in a small pond, and Coniraya emptied these
into the ocean and thus peopled it. The angry deity tried to outwit
Coniraya and kill him, but he was too wise and escaped. He returned to
Huarochiri, and played tricks as before on the villagers.</p>
<p class="par">Coniraya slightly approximates to the Jurupari of the
Uap&egrave;s Indians of Brazil, especially as regards his impish

for feeding, but the beast moaned and would not eat, and on its master
questioning it, it said there was little wonder it was sad, because in
five days the sea would rise and engulf the earth. The man, alarmed,
asked if there was no way of escape, and the llama advised him to go to
the top of a high mountain, Villa-coto, taking food for five days. When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=

birds and animals were already there. When the sea rose the water came
so near that it washed the tail of a fox, and that is why foxes&rsquo;
tails are black! After five days the water fell, leaving only this one
man alive, and from him the Peruvians believed the present human race
to be descended.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Myth of Huathiacuri</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After the deluge the Indians chose the bravest and
richest man as leader. This period they called Purunpacha (the time
without a king). On a high mountain-top appeared five large eggs, from
one of which Paricaca, father of Huathiacuri, later emerged.
Huathiacuri, who was so poor that he had not means to cook his food
properly, learned much wisdom from his father, and the following story
shows how this assisted him. A certain man had built a most curious
house, the roof being made of yellow and red birds&rsquo; feathers. He
was very rich, possessing many llamas, and was greatly esteemed on
account of his wealth. So proud did he become that he aspired to be the
creator himself; but when he became very ill and could not cure himself
his divinity seemed doubtful. Just at this time Huathiacuri was
travelling about, and one day he saw two foxes meet and listened to
their conversation. From this he heard about the rich man and learned
the cause of his illness, and forthwith he determined to go on to find
him. On arriving at the curious house he met a lovely young girl, one
of the rich man&rsquo;s daughters. She told him about her
father&rsquo;s illness, and Huathiacuri, charmed with her, said he
would cure her father if she would only give him her love. He looked so
ragged and dirty that she refused, but she took him to her father and
informed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>him that Huathiacuri said he could cure him. Her
father consented to give him an opportunity to do so. Huathiacuri began
his cure by telling the sick man that his wife had been unfaithful, and
that there were two serpents hovering above his house to devour it, and
a toad with two heads under his grinding-stone. His wife at first
indignantly denied the accusation, but on Huathiacuri reminding her of
some details, and the serpents and toad being discovered, she confessed
her guilt. The reptiles were killed, the man recovered, and the
daughter was married to Huathiacuri.</p>
<p class="par">Huathiacuri&rsquo;s poverty and raggedness displeased
the girl&rsquo;s brother-in-law, who suggested to the bridegroom a
contest in dancing and drinking. Huathiacuri went to seek his
father&rsquo;s advice, and the old man told him to accept the challenge
and return to him. Paricaca then sent him to a mountain, where he was
changed into a dead llama. Next morning a fox and its vixen carrying a
jar of <i>chicha</i> came, the fox having a flute of many pipes. When
they saw the dead llama they laid down their things and went toward it
to have a feast, but Huathiacuri then resumed his human form and gave a
loud cry that frightened away the foxes, whereupon he took possession
of the jar and flute. By the aid of these, which were magically
endowed, he beat his brother-in-law in dancing and drinking.</p>
<p class="par">Then the brother-in-law proposed a contest to prove who
was the handsomer when dressed in festal attire. By the aid of Paricaca
Huathiacuri found a red lion-skin, which gave him the appearance of
having a rainbow round his head, and he again won.</p>
<p class="par">The next trial was to see who could build a house the
quickest and best. The brother-in-law got all his men to help, and had
his house nearly finished before the other had his foundation laid. But
here again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>Paricaca&rsquo;s wisdom proved of service, for
Huathiacuri got animals and birds of all kinds to help him during the
night, and by morning the building was finished except the roof. His
brother-in-law got many llamas to come with straw for his roof, but
Huathiacuri ordered an animal to stand where its loud screams
frightened the llamas away, and the straw was lost. Once more
Huathiacuri won the day. At last Paricaca advised Huathiacuri to end
this conflict, and he asked his brother-in-law to see who could dance
best in a blue shirt with white cotton round the loins. The rich man as
usual appeared first, but when Huathiacuri came in he made a very loud
noise and frightened him, and he began to run away. As he ran
Huathiacuri turned him into a deer. His wife, who had followed him, was
turned into a stone, with her head on the ground and her feet in the
air, because she had given her husband such bad advice.</p>
<p class="par">The four remaining eggs on the mountain-top then opened,
and four falcons issued, which turned into four great warriors. These
warriors performed many miracles, one of which consisted in raising a
storm which swept away the rich Indian&rsquo;s house in a flood to the
sea.</p>

<h3 class="main">Paricaca</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Having assisted in the performance of several
miracles, Paricaca set out determined to do great deeds. He went to
find Caruyuchu Huayallo, to whom children were sacrificed. He came one
day to a village where a festival was being celebrated, and as he was
in very poor clothes no one took any notice of him or offered him
anything, till a young girl, taking pity on him, brought him
<i>chicha</i> to drink. In gratitude Paricaca told her to seek a place
of safety for herself, as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327"
href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>village would be destroyed
after five days, but she was to tell no one of this. Annoyed at the
inhospitality of the people, Paricaca then went to a hill-top and sent
down a fearful storm and flood, and the whole village was destroyed.
Then he came to another village, now San Lorenzo. He saw a very
beautiful girl, Choque Suso, crying bitterly. Asking her why she wept,
she said the maize crop was dying for want of water. Paricaca at once
fell in love with this girl, and after first damming up the little
water there was, and thus leaving none for the crop, he told her he
would give her plenty of water if she would only return his love. She
said he must get water not only for her own crop but for all the other
farms before she could consent. He noticed a small rill, from which, by
opening a dam, he thought he might get a sufficient supply of water for
the farms. He then got the assistance of the birds in the hills, and
animals such as snakes, lizards, and so on, in removing any obstacles
in the way, and they widened the channel so that the water irrigated
all the land. The fox with his usual cunning managed to obtain the post
of engineer, and carried the canal to near the site of the church of
San Lorenzo. Paricaca, having accomplished what he had promised, begged
Choque Suso to keep her word, which she willingly did, but she proposed
living at the summit of some rocks called Yanacaca. There the lovers
stayed very happily, at the head of the channel called Cocochallo, the
making of which had united them; and as Choque Suso wished to remain
there always, Paricaca eventually turned her into a stone.</p>
<p class="par">In all likelihood this myth was intended to account for
the invention of irrigation among the early Peruvians, and from being a
local legend probably spread over the length and breadth of the
country.</p>

<h3 class="main">Conclusion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The advance in civilisation attained by the
peoples of America must be regarded as among the most striking
phenomena in the history of mankind, especially if it be viewed as an
example of what can be achieved by isolated races occupying a peculiar
environment. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the cultures and
mythologies of old Mexico and Peru were evolved without foreign
assistance or intervention, that, in fact, they were distinctively and
solely the fruit of American aboriginal thought evolved upon American
soil. An absorbing chapter in the story of human advancement is
provided by these peoples, whose architecture, arts, graphic and
plastic, laws and religions prove them to have been the equals of most
of the Asiatic nations of antiquity, and the superiors of the primitive
races of Europe, who entered into the heritage of civilisation through
the gateway of the East. The aborigines of ancient America had evolved
for themselves a system of writing which at the period of their
discovery was approaching the alphabetic type, a mathematical system
unique and by no means despicable, and an architectural science in some
respects superior to any of which the Old World could boast. Their
legal codes were reasonable and founded upon justice; and if their
religions were tainted with cruelty, it was a cruelty which they
regarded as inevitable, and as the doom placed upon them by sanguinary
and insatiable deities and not by any human agency.</p>
<p class="par">In comparing the myths of the American races with the
deathless stories of Olympus or the scarcely less classic tales of
India, frequent resemblances and analogies cannot fail to present
themselves, and these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>are of value as illustrating the
circumstance that in every quarter of the globe the mind of man has
shaped for itself a system of faith based upon similar principles. But
in the perusal of the myths and beliefs of Mexico and Peru we are also
struck with the strangeness and remoteness alike of their
subject-matter and the type of thought which they present. The result
of centuries of isolation is evident in a profound contrast of
&ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo; It seems almost as if we stood for a space
upon the dim shores of another planet, spectators of the doings of a
race of whose modes of thought and feeling we were entirely
ignorant.</p>
<p class="par">For generations these stories have been hidden, along
with the memory of the gods and folk of whom they tell, beneath a thick
dust of neglect, displaced here and there only by the efforts of
antiquarians working singly and unaided. Nowadays many well-equipped
students are striving to add to our knowledge of the civilisations of
Mexico and Peru. To the mythical stories of these peoples, alas! we
cannot add. The greater part of them perished in the flames of the
Spanish <i>autos-de-f&eacute;</i>. But for those which have survived we
must be grateful, as affording so many casements through which we may
catch the glitter and gleam of civilisations more remote and bizarre
than those of the Orient, shapes dim yet gigantic, misty yet
many-coloured, the ghosts of peoples and beliefs not the least splendid
and solemn in the roll of dead nations and vanished faiths.

<p class="par">NOTE ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF THE MEXICAN, MAYAN, AND
PERUVIAN LANGUAGES</p>
<p class="par"><span class="sc">Mexican</span></p>
<p class="par">As the Spanish alphabet was that first employed to
represent Mexican or Nahuatl phonology, so Mexican words and names must
be pronounced, for the most part, according to the Castilian system. An
exception is the letter <i>x</i>, which in Spanish is sometimes written
as <i>j</i> and pronounced as <i>h</i> aspirate; and in Nahuatl
sometimes as in English, at other times as <i>sh</i> or <i>s</i>. Thus
the word &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; is pronounced by the aboriginal Mexican
with the hard <i>x</i>, but by the Spaniard as
&ldquo;May-hee-co.&rdquo; The name of the native author Ixtlilxochitl
is pronounced &ldquo;Ishtlilshotshitl,&rdquo; the <i>ch</i> being
articulated as <i>tsh</i>, for euphony. Xochicalco is
&ldquo;So-chi-cal-co.&rdquo; The vowel sounds are pronounced as in
French or Italian. The <i>tl</i> sound is pronounced with almost a
click of the tongue.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="sc">Mayan</span></p>
<p class="par">The Maya alphabet consists of twenty-two letters, of
which <i>c</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>pp</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>tz</i>
are peculiar to the language, and cannot be properly pronounced by
Europeans. It is deficient in the letters <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>,
<i>j</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>. The remaining letters are
sounded as in Spanish. The letter <i>x</i> occurring at the beginning
of a word is pronounced <i>ex</i>. For example, Xbalanque is pronounced
&ldquo;Exbalanke.&rdquo; The frequent occurrence of elisions in spoken
Maya renders its pronunciation a matter of great difficulty, and the
few grammars on the language agree as to the hopelessness of conveying
any true idea of the exact articulation of the language by means of
written directions. Norman in his work entitled <i>Rambles in
Yucatan</i> remarks: &ldquo;This perhaps accounts for the disappearance
of all grammars and vocabularies of the Maya tongue from the peninsula
of Yucatan, the priests finding it much easier to learn the language
directly from the Indian than to acquire it from books.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="sc">Peruvian</span></p>
<p class="par">The two languages spoken in Peru in ancient times were
the Quichua, or Inca, and the Aymara. These still survive. The former
was the language of the Inca rulers of the country, but both sprang
from one common linguistic stock. As these languages were first reduced
to writing by means of a European alphabet, their pronunciation
presents but little difficulty, the words practically begin pronounced
as they are written, having regard to the &ldquo;Continental&rdquo;
pronunciation of the vowels. In Quichua the same sound is give to the
intermediate <i>c</i> before a consonant and to the final <i>c</i>, as
in &ldquo;chacra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pachacamac.&rdquo; The general
accent is most frequently on the penultimate syllable<span class="corr"

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
